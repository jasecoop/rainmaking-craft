He decided to conduct an experiment. He sat down with his family to try and construct a central view of all of their household finances, both incoming and outgoing. All the paycheques, credit cards, pension plans, investments, mortgages, loans etc&hellip;for everyone. And he couldn’t do it. The struggles his own household were having was reflected in most banks inability to produce a comprehensive, centralised view of their customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have spent the past few years writing about the challenges banks face when looking to connect better with their customers. I have hammered home the idea that there is only one channel &mdash; the customer channel. But I have never looked at myself, to illustrate this, with a personal story.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Missed&nbsp;connections</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>My family is a strange beast. Our relationship with providers of financial services is almost, exclusively centred on one bank. We have our joint account, our mortgage, our credit cards, ISAs, pensions, savings accounts &mdash; all with the same institution. That should mean if any bank has a clear, helicopter view of my family’s financial situation &mdash; or even recognize who I am &mdash; it should be my bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’d think.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, we decided to redo our mortgage to get a better rate &mdash; on the advice of our relationship manager. (We’ll call him ‘Alan’ for the sake of this story). When we sent in the forms, the bank came back to my husband to say ‘Wait, your wife (who is named on your joint account) doesn’t live at the address where we were doing the remortgage.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What, wait, what?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s back up a bit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My family &mdash; which is myself, my husband and our son (and at the time a hamster &mdash; RIP ‘Kevin’) –moved to a new house in 2013. It’s a lovely house, with a double layer garden, big kitchen, on a dead end street, detached &mdash; but those aren’t the details you, the reader, should be concerned with now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who has moved house knows the joys of ‘changing your addresses at every credit card, loyalty points scheme, electoral register etc&hellip;One of the first addresses we changed was on our joint account. Actually, the first address we changed, was on our mortgage papers, which has both my husband’s and my name on it. Then we changed our joint account. Which is where our standing order for our mortgage is paid out from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had two blissful years of living in our lovely, London suburbs house, paying our mortgage out of our joint account. Paper documents, listing these accounts, were posted to our domestic idyll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we tried to remortgage. We found out, that according to our bank &mdash; I still lived at the little Victoria terraced house, on a street in southeast London &mdash; where we have lived two years prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mind you &mdash; my credit card travelled to the new house (it has five bedrooms and a grannie flat &mdash; you really must drop by when you are in town) My savings account, travelled to the new house. My Sainsbury’s Nectar points card &mdash; switched address. But only my husband’s side of the *joint-account* travelled a few miles, to the outskirts of London, to the Kent borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why? Because it was only my husband, who changed the address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To quote our relationship manager &mdash; “We do not *assume* that that both names on a joint account live at the same&nbsp;address.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>:-|</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please do not argue with me about bank procedure and KYC and regulations &mdash; like you work at a bank. Think, for a second, like a customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years after moving. Two years after dealing with my bank from the same address. Two years’ worth of ‘customer transaction data’ (yes, I know <em>banks</em> can’t really use that!) Two years after *signing* the mortgage papers in a branch of the bank! 18 years of being a customer of this bank. I had to travel to a branch to produce documentation to prove who I was and where I lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*That* is stupid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Losing the Customer Experience Battle</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why banks are losing the customer experience battle. Right there. Ground zero. The Lumley Household. Kent, UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem lies not in banks refusing to fix the customer experience problem. It lies in the current structure of regulations, legacy infrastructure and culture at banks that make it almost impossible to change the desire to be ‘customer-centric’ into an actual working practice.All of the products that my family holds with our bank &mdash; from the current accounts, credit cards, mortgage etc.. &mdash; all of those products are held in separate, distinct databases. Universal banks do not emerge fully formed from the head of the banking gods. They are constructed over time, through waves of acquisitions, and infrastructure products focused on product segments. These projects are built by IT teams that are often seconded in from outside firms (like IBM or Accenture) to work for 18 to 24 months at a time (depending on the project) and, more often than not, have very little direct knowledge of the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The customer story inside a bank is not held in a book or a central database. It is held in ‘little pockets of data’ spread all around the bank, in various locations, in an assortment of programming languages and platforms and architecture. These ‘little pockets of data’ never interact, are never reconciled, redundancies are never discovered &mdash; and most importantly &mdash; opportunities are never explored.</p>', '[\"longForm\"]', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, '2016-10-25 16:07:24', '2016-11-15 17:37:52', '1cac6178-d67a-450b-8d57-5d5f11ea41d9'),

A real-life person, with wants and desires, flaws and problems &mdash; and then create a banking relationship for that ‘person’. I was amazed by the variety of different people created by each group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A group of designers created an old age pensioner, who lived in a rural community and was a widower. Some consultants outlined a single mother of two, who lived in the Northeast in the UK, and was going back to school to continue her education. Yet another group constructed a former addict in London, who had served in Iraq.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My group, the bankers? This was our guy:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol><li>A man (I think we ended up calling him Trevor)</li><li>28 years old.

(They were all getting collective hard-ons about the type of small business loans their bank would sell to this future Steve Jobs of the UK.) I had to ask &mdash; ‘<em>Does this perfect human being have any flaws? Any problems?’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They stared at me blankly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘<em>Ok, guys &mdash; is he married, does he have a girlfriend</em>?’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No&nbsp;girlfriend as of yet &mdash; but definitely wants to get married some day</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wrote &mdash; ‘<em>Uses Tinder’</em> on a Post-It</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really, online dating? Would our guy do that?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‘<em>YES!</em>’ I screamed. (The room got a bit quiet then) ‘<em>Your perfect, 28 year old Oxbridge grad, with an endless disposable income &mdash; given that he has a pension AND owns his own home in London &mdash; cannot actually magic up the perfect trophy wife at will. He uses Tinder just like all the rest of you</em>.’</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group started discussing what type of cool, hip tech startup this guy would start before his 30th birthday.‘</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Gentlemen!</em> (I can get loud when I’m not being heard&nbsp;;-) ) <em>Focus &mdash; before you start selling ‘Trevor’ a wide range of banking products, we have to discuss his flaws, his quirks &mdash; the stuff that makes him a real human being. Does he have a gambling problem, for example?’</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that point one of the men in the group took my pink Post-It pad and Sharpie and wrote ‘Buys scratch cards’ on a sheet and triumphantly stuck it on the flip board.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Person&nbsp;Before&nbsp;Product</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Why am I telling you this story?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week I was asked to think about some stories that addressed customer facing problems that banks can try and solve.

Financial News published their annual <a href=\"http://www.efinancialnews.com/gallery/financial-news-women-finance-survey\" target=\"_blank\">Women in Finance</a>&nbsp;survey &mdash; and the results show a mostly discouraged and, almost, depressed female workforce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What tends to get me angry (and I am trying not to write blogs angry anymore &mdash; however, passion is my muse!) is that whenever anyone in this industry talks about diversity, the burden of proof tends to fall on the people advocating diversity rather than those who sit idly by accepting the status quo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When just advocating the need for more women (just women, mind you! &mdash; 50 percent of the population!) to participate in the FinTech space, statistics need to be rolled out highlighting how female led business tend to be more profitable or showing that adding women to their boards adds to a company’s longevity. Debates around systematic basis within financial services and tech, the glass ceiling and whether or not women know how to adequately ‘lean in’ (or whether they even need to) are starting to grate on my last nerve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, in an effort to cultivate this attitude of focusing in the positive, I am going to throw out a brand new, entirely unscientific theory about why there needs to be more women in the FinTech space and why your company needs to hire more women now.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why You Need To Hire More Women- Now</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Women are more fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There, I said it. Women make work more pleasant. They laugh, they are supportive. I don’t know many women who would sit and lecture for an hour on the PSD, in a stuffy room, in a grey suit. But I know many who would chat about the ramifications of the PSD 2, while wearing statement jewellery and sipping a glass of wine. Which room would you rather sit in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There it is &mdash; my positive vibes for this week. Women make work and life and Tuesday night meetups talking about digital banking with Lloyds’ John Webster &mdash; a lot more fun.

Inside Out!', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '<h2>How to Foster An Innovation Culture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Many large firms are currently grappling with ways to incorporate a more innovative culture into their development and organisational environments. As with any large transformational project, success or failure tend to depend on the right mix of culture and human relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This was the main crux of the discussion at the inaugural Rainmaking Session &mdash; How to foster a corporate innovation culture &mdash; hosted by Rainmaking Innovation in May.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>A wide range of corporate innovation leaders and learners from organisations as diverse as Standard & Poors, BP and SwissRe gathered to hear a discussion led by Rachael Jackson, Solutions, Design, Services at RBS and Alex Farcet, partner at Rainmaking Innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The conversation around the table, conducted under the Chatham House Rule, came thick and fast as participants&nbsp;relayed stories of their own companies’ internal challenges, strategies and successes. The only interruption to the discussion came when two enormous anti-terrorist transformer helicopters buzzed over&nbsp;the Rainmaking Loft!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"{asset:309:url}\" alt=\"Picture1_161031_172030.png#asset:309\"><br></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Our Findings</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The main findings from the roundtable were as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation leaders at corporations need to operate with one leg inside an organisation and one leg outside. Being outside a firm allows the leaders to learn and discover new technologies and new business models that can transform the enterprise. While keeping a foot inside a company, keeps lines of communication and collaboration open with senior people at the firm.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This line of talk moved onto a debate on whether innovation departments need to be centralised, and separate from the main organisation, with their own staff, budget and authority, or decentralised. The centralised model had the advantages of a separate budget line which would allow projects to develop without relying on the P&L of separate business units. The decentralised approach emphasised the importance of encouraging the entire firm to engage in innovation projects and activities.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation tends to signal change for most companies and change is scary. People and culture are key to ensuring that establishing an&nbsp;innovation culture is seen as beneficial and empowering to the rest of the organisation.<img src=\"{asset:140:url}\" alt=\"1KuyS3TbSOtuUIL3loV17JA.png#asset:140\"></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Many around the Rainmaking Session breakfast table recognised that a large number of&nbsp;innovation projects were led by either senior management or staff working hands on in development. It was the so-called ‘middle layer’ that was most in need of empowerment when it came to innovation. A large proportion of the group argued that this ‘middle layer’ was not incentivised to try anything new or to embark on innovation projects that have the possibility of failure embedded in their DNA.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation projects are hard to measure, and including metrics at all might be detrimental to its successes. However, most large corporates operate in a risk culture that requires performance metrics and measurement. The ‘can’t live with metrics/can’t live without metrics’ debate continues.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Advice to Startups</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, the roundtable debate focused engaging with and working with startups. The large corporate around the table all expressed an interest and a desire to work with startups &mdash; given that the search for new technologies and solutions is often found in the startup community.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Their advice for any startup looking to sell into or partner with a larger organisation was to make sure that they presented their value proposition in a way that made sense for the corporate and their clients’ needs. If that value proposition was met correctly, a partnership between a corporate and a startup would be more likely to be successful. These successful projects could then be used as evidence to the rest of the company that embarking on an innovation culture was beneficial and worthwhile.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Please join us, or invite a colleague, for our next Rainmaking Session on June 16th &mdash; What’s the matter with payments?</em></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>You will hear from:</em>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul><li><em>Jon Prideaux, CEO at Boku</em></li><li><em>Richard Jackson, UK Managing Director, WoraPay</em></li></ul>\r\n\r\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/the-rainmaking-sessions-whats-the-matter-with-payments-tickets-25602215917\">Learn more here</a></em></p>', '[\"longForm\"]', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, '2016-10-25 16:31:26', '2016-11-15 17:38:43', '8d9546bc-f6f1-436e-b34c-2c8917b34356'),

As the group munched on bacon rolls and sipped tea and coffee, all were in the room with the understanding that small to medium sized businesses are a group that is under loved, underserved and ripe with opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The roundtable discussion, led by Justin Hannemann, Head of Product Experience (Customer and Innovation), Santander UK and Johanna Pugh, global head of Lending, Misys caused several themes to emerge from the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SMEs are quite diverse and can range from everything from a tech-savvy FinTech startup in London to a cat grooming store in Sheffield, for example. This makes SMEs hard to classify and are seen as risky and complex by banks. Categorisation is hard when <a href=\"http://blog.thecompanywarehouse.co.uk/2012/07/31/what-is-an-sme/\">definitions differ</a> between UK government departments, HMRC and even the EU. As banks enhance their services to retail customers and larger commercial organisations, SMEs get pushed to the bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal bank politics as well as legacy systems don’t make it easier for traditional firms to develop services that meets the needs of most SMEs. Many banks make due with an enhanced retail bank offering or a ‘lite’ version of their corporate offerings &mdash; both versions tend to fall short of meeting SME needs. Legacy systems inside banks can also make it difficult to shift customer accounts from one product set to another if an SME is initially put in the ‘retail portfolio’ at the bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite much discussion around open APIs and working with FinTech startups, many banks around the table favoured a more human approach to better meet SME needs. Bringing customers into the bank, even giving some of them a seat on the board, was seen as the main tool to better understand SME needs and break down internal barriers at the bank. “They are the boss,” was one comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SME pain points can be huge. They are working 24/7 to keep their business running, but many lack basic accounting skills or are uneasy about chasing unpaid invoices. SMEs are looking for control and simplification, according to the roundtable. SMEs want to be able to make deposits, get invoices paid and not have to deal with complex or confusing financial products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital did not reign supreme with SME needs either. Many SMEs are looking for access to human-led customer service where they could pick up the phone and speak to an expert at any time. “When you are dealing with amounts over six figures, people want a personal chat, not 100% digital”, was one roundtable comment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, the majority of businesses can be classified as small businesses. The future of SMEs is central to the future of FinTech and corporate banking. Empowering SMEs and helping them shape their future is a huge opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about Rainmaking Innovation follow us on @rainmakinginnov or visit us at <a href=\"https://rainmaking.io/\">https://rainmaking.io/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://rainmaking.io/\"></a>To find out more about Misys visit <a href=\"http://www.misys.com/solutions/fusionbanking/lending/\">http://www.misys.com/solutions/fusionbanking/lending/</a></p>', '[\"longForm\"]', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, '2016-10-25 16:34:20', '2016-11-15 17:37:10', 'd3ff8a28-9e15-4df2-90aa-83e017d74a04'),

The session looked at the establishment of the Regulatory Sandbox run by the Financial Conduct Authority and the appetite and capability of many incumbent banks to participate in the new scheme and partner with new entrants to the financial services landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outcome? There are many footprints in the sandbox, but many may have to wait some time for impressive castles to be built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FCA’s Regulatory Sandbox is meant to be a legal framework or a ‘safe space’ where businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms. This is a progressive step for startups in regulated industries, like financial services. However, many young companies still need active partnerships with established banks, firms and other corporates in order to test developing products with live data, enterprise architecture and an active customer base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sandboxes, like the one set up by the FCA in the UK, are a step in the right direction for regulated industries. But they struggle to be useful if certain startups aren’t given the resources to test their products, properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FCA sandbox was designed to allow for collaboration. Currently, there are many FinTech startups involved in the programme. The FCA does not make public the names or the number of startups participating in the sandbox. However, many of these companies still require participation from incumbent banks in order to adequately test their offerings in the safe legal framework the FCA has established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However many banks, themselves, are working on creating their own innovation labs to not only support and welcome new technology and services entrants, but to enable and empower their own internal staff to embrace innovation. Many in this industry know that incumbent banks and financial services firms move at a pace considered much slower than is enjoyed in the Silicon Valley-style startup world. This is true even for banks that are working towards creating a more agile and flexible work environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The window of opportunity is open now to work within the FCA Regulatory Sandbox.

Insurers without a plan for some form of chatbot pilot risk losing out as online advertising undergoes its next big step change.</p>\r\n<p>Chatbots are the hottest customer-centric innovative technology of 2016 so far. In March,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/30/11332494/microsoft-bot-framework-build\">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;announced the launch of a new platform that will enable anyone to build one. In April,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/12/agents-on-messenger/\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;announced the launch of chatbots on its existing Messenger platform.</p>\r\n<p>What are chatbots? At the most basic level, these are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate conversations with a real person.</p>\r\n<p>They have the obvious potential benefit of replacing customer service staff – or freeing up those employees for other tasks, thus increasing productivity. But the marketing potential is even greater, as they enable companies to initiate conversations with customers online based on what sites they’re on and what kind of services they might be looking for.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Targeting new customers more effectively</strong></p>\r\n<p>In insurance, they could be used to replace the need to fill out long, tedious forms. Not only that, but since a chatbot can initiate a conversation, you can use them to proactively target prospective customers rather than wait for them to come to you. This is the vision behind Spixii, a startup we’ve been working with at InsurTech.</p>\r\n<p>Spixii aims to make the buying of health and travel insurance more intuitive and fun for millennials, and to generate more revenues for insurers by opening up the relatively untapped millennial market – and then upselling to these consumers in a more targeted and less pushy manner.</p>\r\n<p>With Spixii, the chatbot acts you’re having an online conversation with a human insurance agent, asking you questions and responding to your answers. The consumer gets a more engaging experience than just filling out a form, while the insurer can carry out an accurate risk assessment.</p>\r\n<p>Right now Spixii has several tier one insurers interested in partnering with them to run a pilot. They also have just been accepted on the Allianz Accelerator programme in France to test their offering further. Cynics may dismiss the technology as a gimmick. But no one can afford not to start experimenting with it, for one very simple reason: Facebook wants to supplant Google as the number one advertising platform on the internet, and they’re investing heavily in chatbots to help them do this.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Facebook is no longer a social media company – here’s why that matters</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/10/11640140/facebook-media-influence\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;is no longer a social network. It’s a technology holding company just like Google, and it now comprises social media, photo-sharing (Instagram), messaging (WhatsApp) and virtual reality (Oculus). It’s also the largest media distributor in history.</p>\r\n<p>The company has grown with one goal: to make it so that no one who uses the internet ever has to leave the Facebook platform. Once we reach “Peak Facebook” – the point at which the majority of the world’s internet users spend all their internet time on one or other of Facebook’s apps – it will become pointless to advertise anywhere else.</p>\r\n<p>After all, Facebook already tales up 22% of the internet time that Americans spend on mobile devices, compared with 11% on Google search and YouTube combined. And Facebook\'s advertising revenues have more than doubled in the last two years, to <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21696507-social-network-has-turned-itself-one-worlds-most-influential-technology-giants\">$18 billion in 2015</a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Chatbot failure is not an option</strong></p>\r\n<p>And why is Facebook so interested in chatbots? Because by creating its own advertising platform, it can control how people buy products and services online. Specifically, the company wants the whole transaction to take place within its own platform – so customers never have to leave it. And hosting chatbots looks set to be one of the most effective ways of doing this.</p>\r\n<p>Now, this trend towards internet dominance may or may not pay off. And it certainly throws up some questions about the fact that Facebook could end up with complete control – or at least de facto dominance – over how companies can advertise to their consumers online. But Facebook’s growth has been so phenomenal, and its increasing influence so unstoppable, that running some kind of chatbot pilot is not something insurers can afford to see as a luxury. It’s a necessity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How insurers can exploit this trend</strong></p>\r\n<p>The fastest way to trial your own chatbot is through partnerships and pilots – either with technology companies themselves or with innovative startups who aim to solve a business problem that you’re struggling with.</p>\r\n<p>To go back to the example of Spixii I mentioned before: this company represents an ideal opportunity for insurers to tap into the millennial market, and, in so doing, to investigate how the technology could be extended to reach other markets and develop attractive new propositions and products. Plus, it potentially offers a level of customer engagement and insight for small premium insurance products that just wouldn’t be affordable otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>Facebook is serious about this technology. If successful, it could transform the world of online advertising beyond recognition. It may be that insurers can’t afford not to trial the technology, but those who are successful stand to reap huge potential rewards.</p>', '[\"longForm\"]', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, '2016-10-25 16:48:05', '2016-12-06 11:44:56', 'd66c125c-be7b-4a72-80b4-ac2994564fed'),

Are you the 800 pound gorilla?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;We talked about this a lot when I first joined DCG – Why do we come to work in the morning? What inspires us? What motivates us?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think all of us fundamentally see bitcoin blockchain technology changing the financial system and the broader technology landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn’t matter if we’re the 800 pound gorilla or the small upstart. I think for us we want to have an outsize impact and be an advocate, an evangelist, and the connector that helps make this industry more successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see accelerators as a good idea for bitcoin and blockchain startups?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, absolutely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing I have noticed is that people who have gone through an accelerator program were much better at pitching, were much better at selling the value proposition, and were much better at creating a narrative. That skill set cannot be underestimated. You’re going through this rigorous program that’s designed to teach you all of these fantastic skills and competencies, and you’re learning from some of the best corporate VCs, the best corporate strategists, the best VCs, the best startup mentors that you normally wouldn’t have access to in your network. It’s a great way to compress that learning in a really short timeline and to really grow your network and also get great PR. No brainer for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously, we’re super excited to have Startupbootcamp FinTech here and really excited about the startups that will go through your program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesse: &nbsp;What’s your general advice for startups who might be applying for an accelerator?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;I think people are always a little hesitant about applying. They think: “Oh, it’s three months away from product development. That’s difficult. I want to focus on the tech.” No, no, no, no! Spend three months really getting good at sales, at communicating, at branding, at messaging, building relationships. That is going to do so much more for you&nbsp;than building a great product because growth takes two things. It takes a great product, but it also takes a great sales strategy. Remember that there’s more to the equation than just the technology and really focus on this opportunity to develop relationships and competencies that are going to help you grow beyond the seed stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you see the venture capital model heading in five years?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;I think a lot more people are excited about venture capital. A lot of people want to be investors. It’s like a sexy thing to do right now, which is great. I love it. The more money that goes into the ecosystem, the more ideas start getting thrown around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I think you’re seeing, though, is a decoupling of the size of the check that an investor’s able to write and the value that they’re able to add to an early stage company. We at DCG invest at the seed stage. We aim for 2% to 5% ownership, but we write smaller cheques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you’re going to start to see are two different types of investors. You’re going to see one investor who’s really focused on network effects, on connectivity, who’s really focused on value-added services, and another investor that’s really focused on late stage growth. They’re going to play two very different roles within the life cycle of a startup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;What advice would you have for companies who want to pitch DCG?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp; For us, we’re seed stage investors. What our investing team looks at are three things. Number one, the team. Who are you? What’s your track record and what’s your story? Why are you starting this company? We need to see that you have grit and that you have determination and that you really care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second is product. Technically, what have you built? Open source software is notoriously competitive, so having teams that are technically competent is very important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then the last one is market. How do you think about monetization, and what’s the timeline on that? We’re different from most VCs in that we’re not a fund. We don’t have a certain timeline. If it’s going to take you 10 years to reach profitability, I think we’re okay with that, but you need to have a plan and then you need to have a backup plan and a backup plan to the backup plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the role of Community Manager, how do you see it evolving?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started my role was pretty specific. It was focused on developing better connective tissue between our companies. Now that we have a number of strategic investors on board we started to realize the value of having a broad network. For me, it’s about building the DCG brand, building relationships, and also creating new opportunities and new ways of thinking around how to internalize innovation within a large organization. &nbsp;It’s about taking the community role, untangling into the various components that really move the needle and making it more of a discipline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To read the full interview, please click<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-interview-meltem-demirors-dcg-jesse-podell?published=t\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;here</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Follow&nbsp;Meltem Demirors on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem\" target=\"_blank\"></a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;–</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dcg.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Currency Group&nbsp;</a>manages a large early stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain space.

We might feel that we intrinsically grasp its meaning, but how many of us can actually articulate what it means, especially as it relates to our specific business?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation has increasingly become a marketing buzzword, diluted by firms selling out of the box solutions to capitalize on what has become a blossoming hype curve.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wanted to know how to better support our partners in the future and avoid falling into the tropes of others. So, we conducted a survey of over 80 participants from the Rainmaking community that self-identified as working in the corporate innovation management space. The results are illuminating, and worth sharing. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s a sample of what the community said about </strong><strong>“</strong><strong>innovation</strong><strong>”</strong><img src=\"{asset:207:url}\" alt=\"Picture11.png#asset:207\">It is easy to see how the word <em>innovation</em> has become confused and abused. Responses ranged from bringing about sweeping visionary change all the way to solving a specific problem. There’s a lack of agreement on what the output of innovation should look like.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, the responses can seem at odds. We think this is actually to be expected. Closer inspection shows there are consistent themes:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol><li>There must be a positive change; something done, something created</li><li>That change must be new; sometimes iterative, sometimes radical</li></ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Outcomes for innovation initiatives are defined based on their context in the specific market, industry or organization. It’s very specific to your circumstances. In summary, the most important definition of innovation is your own. <em>Innovation is</em><em>&hellip;</em><em>in the eye of the beholder.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s the current feeling about the </strong><strong>“</strong><strong>innovation industry</strong><strong>”&nbsp;</strong><img src=\"{asset:209:url}\" alt=\"Picture12.png#asset:209\">We loved the honesty!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The industry that supports your initiatives can be noisy and fragmented. You’re fighting to deliver against short and long term objectives. Battling for attention with your core business. What you want is someone that is pragmatic in understanding your specific realities, not traditional strategies from self-proclaimed miracle workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the feedback we received,&nbsp;this quote really spoke to us:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>We agree. When you combine this with the breadth of responses on why innovation is important &mdash; from keeping the lights on, to delivering something tangible, to improving the world &mdash; it is clear that there can be a gap in getting from where you are today to where you’d like to be. The bridge that translates strategy into execution, talk into action.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h2>Start with the biggest risk<img src=\"{asset:190:url}\" alt=\"Screen-Shot-2016-10-26-at-11.32.37.png#a\" style=\"font-family:Arial, \'Helvetica Neue\', Helvetica, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:32px;font-weight:700;color:rgb(41,50,61);\"></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are overlaps with these responses yet the top challenges are clear.

What you hear less of is what banks are actually doing to become more innovative. </p><p>We took a look at four different banks and examples of the strategies that they are employing. <img src=\"{asset:217:url}\" alt=\"thumbnailimage.jpg#asset:217\" style=\"font-family:Arial, \'Helvetica Neue\', Helvetica, Tahoma, sans-serif;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-size:32px;font-weight:700;\" /></p><h1>BNY Mellon</h1><p>BNY Mellon understands the importance of fostering an innovation culture, challenging employees to adopt a flexible mindset that encourages new ways of thinking and an openness to doing things differently.</p><p>BNY Mellon actively mines its employees for innovative ideas and seeks out exceptional talent internally. This focus on ‘intrapreneurship’ is seen through its annual internal innovation competition, A.C.E. This challenges employees to develop innovative ideas, rewarding winners with resources and funding to be incubated in one of the bank’s innovation centers, located in Palo Alto, Pittsburgh, London, New Jersey, Pune and Chennai. Innovation training further helps employees develop ideation skills, whilst a social collaboration platform allows employees to discuss new ideas they are working on and collaborate. </p><p>BNY Mellon’s focus on a cultural shift in mindset has begun to manifest itself in real technological innovation and competence. The bank’s IT departments have adopted agile development practices involving small teams that take a continuous delivery approach to development, rolling out frequent production updates and reducing delivery time.</p><p>Further encouraging an innovative culture, the IT department has increased its ability to collaborate by sharing resources and knowledge across the entire organization. The NEXEN Digital Ecosystem was developed by the bank as way to increase the speed of delivery and value to clients. NEXEN is an open sourced cloud based architecture that includes a methodology for developing API’s with one language and documentation. These API’s are available to the company’s developers and consumers through an API store where they can utilize the platform’s library to create new applications.</p><p>Previously, developers would create applications in their own language and with separate micro-code monitoring. Now they are able to quickly tie together applications via API and manage them in one cloud based management system. Because monitoring is built into the NEXEN system, all applications can be tracked and monitored in unison, allowing for greater data insights and more intelligent decision making.</p><p>This platform was made possible due to the Bank’s commitment to encouraging a mindset of innovation by directly addressing the breadth of change required at every level of the organization and getting strong sponsorship from executive levels.</p><p><img src=\"{asset:219:url}\" alt=\"bbva-open-talent-ganadores-europa-2016_0\" style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:Arial, \'Helvetica Neue\', Helvetica, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-size:40px;font-weight:700;\" /></p><h1>BBVA</h1><p>BBVA’s Strategy and Innovation unit was created in 2007, as part of the Technology and Operations department, whose key objective was to integrate emerging technologies into the banking industry, resulting in projects such as ABIL, the first smart ATM.</p><p>BBVA has turned to open innovation models in order to overcome existing challenges and attract the best talent. BBVA has opened Innovation Centers, such as those in Madrid (Spain) and Bogota (Colombia), and focused on developing a knowledge network around these. This approach depends upon ecosystems for innovation and talent worldwide and seeks to foster a culture of collaboration with entrepreneurs, startups and developers.</p><p>The Innovation Centers generate ideas and accelerates these through a process of experimentation and prototyping. The value of this approach was demonstrated in 2008 when BBVA became one of the first banks in Europe to introduce online money management (PFM).</p><p>The Innovation Centers form hubs, points from which to engage with the wider FinTech ecosystem. BBVA has established an innovation network comprised of partners, such as tech giants Google, IBM, Cisco and Microsoft, as well as academic institutions, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford, commercial organizations, like Gartner and Continuum, and startups. This sharing of knowledge and ideas encourages cross-pollination and helps generate innovation for BBVA.  </p><p>In addition, BBVA hosts the Open Talent Challenge, now in its 8###sup/sup### cycle. This global startup competition focuses on attracting innovative startups that are transforming financial services, offering the winner a place on a two-week Immersion and Interaction program.  </p><p>Most recently, in February 2016 BBVA announced the closure of its in-house venture arm, BBVA Ventures. Instead, BBVA Venture’s portfolio, the $100 million allotted fund, and an additional $150 million, is being put into a new VC – Propel Venture Partners - based in San Francisco and London. BBVA has become a limited partner in Propel and will focus on payments, credit, insurance, wealth management, e-commerce, and security &amp; compliance. The move reflects BBVA’s belief that their increased capital, and Propel’s independence and London presence, will attract the best FinTech startups.</p><h1><img src=\"{asset:220:url}\" alt=\"20151112_130526.jpg#asset:220\" />Santander</h1><p>Santander engages in a wide range of complementary innovation activities. Most notably, Santander has launched Openbank, a fully digital bank, several Digital Labs, and InnoVentures, the bank’s venture capital arm with a FinTech focused fund of over $100 million.</p><p>InnoVentures invests in FinTech startups that the fund believes can add value to the bank’s customers. This is wide ranging, covering everything from payments, alternative lending and personal finance management. The fund also selects investments based on the value that the bank can bring to the startup by introducing customers, helping to establish a strong position within the FinTech ecosystem. In addition to acting as an investment vehicle, InnoVentures serves as a funnel for startups and new technologies into Santander’s other innovation initiatives. Even if InnoVentures does not invest in a startup there is the opportunity to partner with them to explore new technology or specific use cases, through running pilots or proof of concepts.</p><p>Openbank is another example of Santander’s multi layered approach. Serving the Spanish market, Openbank is a completely digital bank that operates under its own brand but is supported by Santander. As a completely digital bank, the venture offers a unique proposition to customers and is a standalone business. Openbank is not reliant on Santander’s central processes and legacy IT infrastructure creating additional value as an innovation initiative as startups’ technologies can be integrated much faster than with Santander itself. <img src=\"{asset:222:url}\" alt=\"Citibank_Chinatown.jpg#asset:222\" /></p><h1>Citi</h1><p>Citi has developed a portfolio of initiatives; engaging both the external innovation ecosystem and creating internal initiatives to encourage new mindsets and ways of working.</p><p>Citi Ventures oversees a global network of labs and, in 2013, established an internal Acceleration Fund to encourage rapid experimentation and discovery. The labs allow Citi to pilot new solutions rapidly, search for disruptive business models and focus on emerging technologies, such as blockchain technology and crytpocurrencies. Citi prioritized these labs early on: in 2009 Citi’s Global Transaction Services business opened it global Research, Development, Innovation and Learning Centre in Dublin. At this time Citi announced an investment of $24 million for the development of a next generation intelligent payments solution bringing Citi’s total investment in research and development in Ireland to $100 million at that time. Citi has subsequently opened other centers in San Francisco, Israel and Singapore.</p><p>These labs play an important role in allowing Citi to connect its innovation teams with clients, employees and, industry experts. Through showcasing innovation initiatives and solutions, senior management, different business lines, and individuals are engaged with, and exposed to, innovative processes, solutions and mindsets. This is also seen with the Citi Ventures Catalyst program which engages Citi executives to share industry expertise, open conversations, and align strategic interests to help drive the company’s innovation agenda.</p><p>Citi runs multiple accelerator programs in order to engage with startups. Their FinTech accelerator was launched in Tel Aviv in 2013 as part of the Citi Innovation Lab TLV, within Citi’s global network of innovation centers. Since then, Citi have partnered with Plug and Play to further expand their accelerator programs and engage with FinTech startups.</p><p>In addition, Citi’s venture capital arm has grown their Investment portfolio to 23 active startups. Through aligning their investment focus with the core business’ needs: Big Data and Analytics, Commerce Payments, Financial Technology, Marketing and Customer Experience, and Security and Enterprise IT, Citi seeks to invest in cutting edge and highly relevant startups to drive innovation.  </p>', '[\"longForm\"]', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, '2016-10-26 13:52:39', '2016-10-31 12:28:48', 'b474f582-2e55-4778-b052-7ffcf2379b65'),

They get very excited, they also feel a lot of pressure to do something and then they randomly do things.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One of the trends that we see, is organizations recognizing that working with startups is one channel but building products startup style is another, so the trend is really focusing on closing that loop. That\'s one of the things we see, the other one is really diversification. So, looking at innovation, not a box ticking exercise, but it\'s something that has to have many different iterations and many different facets.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>On the positive side, we see organizations trying a variety of different things; setting up their own investment funds, working with accelerators, doing their own incubation initiatives, having very structured programs for themselves. But also, putting a lot of effort into internal innovation initiatives by educating people about change, by giving them the opportunity to see other ways of working by giving them the opportunity to collaborate with competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The smart organizations recognize that they need to do multiple things at the same time and they need to allow themselves to fail. They also need to connect the internal and external innovation efforts. If you just take startup engagement for instance; startups come in different stages and they have different needs and also different benefits for the organization. So, you can be part of an accelerator to see very early stage startups, to get excited by the the spirit and the drive and the passion of entrepreneurs, but also just to see the very latest trends.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to using real technology that has been built by startups then you have to look at something that is maybe a little bit more advanced, maybe a little bit more mature, but that engagement has to be different. Maybe it\'s more like a managed lab, maybe it\'s trying to find ways of incorporating the technology into the business. And this is something that often happens by exploring. By using something like a startup studio, something like a separate entity, separate organization, that is bringing people together with startup experience and putting them together with project people from the organization who know about the business.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The interesting thing in this new and evolving landscape is that organizations still sometimes cling on to the idea of “we have to do everything ourselves,” and the smarter organizations recognize that there\'s certain things that you cannot do as a bank, as an insurer, as a large corporate by yourself. Because you don\'t have the know how, you don\'t have the expertise; but also, when It comes to collaboration, which is really important in this space, you usually cannot easily collaborate, by yourself, with other parties. So, having a neutral organization, having somebody like a startupbootcamp who would come in the middle, who brings people around the table and gets them to openly share their challenges, share their problems and priorities, and get them to jointly engage with startups is something that we\'ve seen being very successful.</p>', '[\"shortForm\"]', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, '2016-10-27 09:01:29', '2016-11-15 17:22:32', '5bdb1899-cfe3-4f7b-9cbe-a77c976cd1ff'),

Major corporates are tuning their inhouse hierarchy to fit in “innovation” in their culture, vision and value. To an extent that nowadays, there is a specific job title in major healthcare conglomerates called, “Chief Innovation Officer” to build innovation cultures in the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what exactly is an Innovation culture, and why is it suddenly a necessity? Let us explore this and its role specifically in the field of healthcare.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation Culture is a company environment chosen by the leaders to encourage and facilitate unorthodox ideas and strategies. In these companies, innovation is not just a privilege of the C-level, but employee at any level is encouraged to foster the culture and be innovative in their approach.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>So why is it suddenly a necessity?</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Many companies working the traditional way for decades now suddenly are shifting towards innovation cultures. There are several factors contributing to this shift.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The primary reason for this shift is Digitalization. Digitalization has paced up the market, the customer has a strong voice and bad performance instantly gets bad reviews. Hence, the scope of error has reduced hugely, making it paramount for companies to invent new ways of customer satisfaction.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The second factor weighing in is the rise of startups. Startups are agile and flexible, they are not afraid to be different and to try a road not taken, because they have nothing to lose. Large corporates, on the other hand, have much to lose if they try something that is not a standard norm.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The third and the most crucial factor is the consumer market. Consumers have changed, trust is still valuable but so is creativity. Market models have changed and even the old and established market structures are undergoing a change. This makes innovation paramount.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>But what does innovation culture comprise of?</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation Culture is not a pet project, it is a style of thinking. It is not a creative inborn talent, it is a practiced skill. Which also means that there is not set way or rules to this culture, but every team builds its own culture. Here are some factors we see overlapping in all companies fostering Innovation Culture.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>1.&nbsp;Speed</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The need of innovation arises from fast &nbsp;changing market needs, hence shorter innovation cycles are paramount. Speculation over long time leads to slowness, the very evil corporations are trying to avoid. However, speed needs to come from quick decision making and clarity in vision, and not rash decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Digitalization</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Digitalization is one of the primary reasons behind the shift in markets. So it is imperative for corporates to not just add but make digitalization an integral part of their outreach plan. The consumer expects companies to fill gaps and be more service oriented, and digitalization is the fastest way to address this need.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Open leadership</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While it is important for the company founders and leaders to value and encourage innovation cultures, in successful innovation culture implementation, lower management also believes and practices an open creative culture, as these are the people who function directly with execution and micro manage teams.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Value in failure</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One reason why corporations fail at innovation is because they are risk averse. They are big and protecting the name becomes more and more important. But as one adopts innovation culture, one needs to learn the art of accepting failure. An interesting take is to call a Failure a “glitch”. While a failure sounds painfully permanent, a glitch sounds temporary, solvable and a learning opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Sustaining innovation</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>It is a tough task to get your employees to embrace innovation culture, but it is equally important to get them to stay on course. It can not be just a one-project affair. To get employees to show innovativity in workplace, there can be rewards, from as big as a holiday to as tiny as sincere appreciation.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>6.&nbsp;Flat hierarchy</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Flat hierarchy is a fast-evolving management style that many companies are adopting. Some people call it Bossless Management, some call it Radical Management and some, Holacracy, but the core of the concept remains the same. The concept does away with leadership’s sole decision making power and gives the power to the collective intelligence of all employees. One good example of Holacracy is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://searchcio.techtarget.com/feature/Flap-over-Zappos-holacracy-puts-spotlight-on-bossless-workplace\">Zappos</a>, one of the largest companies to have adopted bossless administration.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>All innovative companies have different missions, but their processes are similar. They encourage unorthodox methods that include speed, flexibility, adaptation of digital technology, flat hierarchies and sustainable innovation.</p>', '[\"longForm\"]', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '0', NULL, '2016-10-27 10:06:47', '2016-11-16 15:15:08', 'a5d7de6c-f74c-481a-a725-2fc68047eea8'),

Due to this charging urban environment, car ownership will become increasingly difficult to support. The risks ranging from worsening air pollution to traffic congestion are incredibly high if municipal governments aren’t open to, and supportive of, mobility options outside of what we are already accustomed to. In addition to changes in public policy, we will also likely see city residents taking initiative and altering their mobility habits as a result of the changes to urban life. This topic of evolving habits in consumer culture leads us to our final trend.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>“Access over Ownership”</h1>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/rachel_botsman_the_case_for_collaborative_consumption?language=en#t-80279\">According to researcher Rachel Botsman</a>, people are “wired to share.” In her book&nbsp;What’s Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption, she explains that we as consumers are currently experiencing a significant shift in values and that we are putting aside our desire for ownership to instead reconnect with products in a more meaningful way.

Being outside a firm allows the leaders to learn and discover new technologies and new business models that can transform the enterprise. While keeping a foot inside a company, keeps lines of communication and collaboration open with senior people at the firm.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This line of talk moved onto a debate on whether innovation departments need to be centralised, and separate from the main organisation, with their own staff, budget and authority or decentralised. The centralised model had the advantages of a separate budget line which would allow projects to develop without relying on the P&L of separate business units. The decentralised approach emphasised the importance of encouraging the entire firm to engage in innovation projects and activities.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation tends to signal change for most companies and change is scary. People and culture are key to ensuring that establishing and innovation culture is seen as beneficial and empowering to the rest of the organisation.<\\/p><p><br><\\/p><p><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/1KuyS3TbSOtuUIL3loV17JA.png#asset:140\\\"><br><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many around the Rainmaking Session breakfast table recognised that many innovation projects were led by either senior management or staff working hands on in development. It was the so-called \\u2018middle layer\\u2019 that was most in need of empowerment when it came to innovation. Many argued that this \\u2018middle layer\\u2019 was not incentivised to try anything new or to embark on innovation projects that have the possibility of failure embedded in its DNA.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation projects are hard to measure, and including metrics at all might be detrimental to its successes. However, most large corporates operate in a risk culture that requires performance metrics and measurement. The \\u2018can\\u2019t live with metrics\\/can\\u2019t live without metrics\\u2019 debate continues.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Finally, the roundtable debate focused engaging with and working with startups. The large corporate around the table all expressed an interest and a desire to work with startups\\u200a&mdash;\\u200agiven that the search for new technologies and solutions is often found in the startup community.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Their advice for any startup looking to sell into or partner with a larger organisation was to make sure that they presented their value proposition in a way that made sense for the corporate and their clients\\u2019 needs. If that value proposition was met correctly, a partnership between a corporate and a startup would be more likely to be successful. These successful projects could then be used as evidence to the rest of the company that embarking on an innovation culture was beneficial and worthwhile.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Please join us, or invite a colleague, for our next Rainmaking Session on June 16th\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aWhat\\u2019s the matter with payments?<\\/i><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>You will hear from:<\\/i><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\u00b7 <i>Jon Prideaux, CEO at Boku<\\/i><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\u00b7 <i>Richard Jackson, UK Managing Director, WoraPay<\\/i><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\\/e\\/the-rainmaking-sessions-whats-the-matter-with-payments-tickets-25602215917\\\"><i><\\/i><\\/a><i><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\\/e\\/the-rainmaking-sessions-whats-the-matter-with-payments-tickets-25602215917\\\">https:\\/\\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\\/e...<\\/a><\\/i><\\/p>\"}}', '2016-10-25 16:31:26', '2016-10-25 16:31:26', '4191ebc4-c72c-4637-be8d-3b2ce6eb2936'),

As the group munched on bacon rolls and sipped tea and coffee, all were in the room with the understanding that small to medium sized businesses are a group that is under loved, underserved and ripe with opportunity.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The roundtable discussion, led by Justin Hannemann, Head of Product Experience (Customer and Innovation), Santander UK and Johanna Pugh, global head of Lending, Misys caused several themes to emerge from the table.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>SMEs are quite diverse and can range from everything from a tech-savvy FinTech startup in London to a cat grooming store in Sheffield, for example. This makes SMEs hard to classify and are seen as risky and complex by banks. Categorisation is hard when <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.thecompanywarehouse.co.uk\\/2012\\/07\\/31\\/what-is-an-sme\\/\\\">definitions differ<\\/a> between UK government departments, HMRC and even the EU. As banks enhance their services to retail customers and larger commercial organisations, SMEs get pushed to the bottom.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Internal bank politics as well as legacy systems don\\u2019t make it easier for traditional firms to develop services that meets the needs of most SMEs. Many banks make due with an enhanced retail bank offering or a \\u2018lite\\u2019 version of their corporate offerings\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aboth versions tend to fall short of meeting SME needs. Legacy systems inside banks can also make it difficult to shift customer accounts from one product set to another if an SME is initially put in the \\u2018retail portfolio\\u2019 at the bank.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Despite much discussion around open APIs and working with FinTech startups, many banks around the table favoured a more human approach to better meet SME needs. Bringing customers into the bank, even giving some of them a seat on the board, was seen as the main tool to better understand SME needs and break down internal barriers at the bank. \\u201cThey are the boss,\\u201d was one comment.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>SME pain points can be huge. They are working 24\\/7 to keep their business running, but many lack basic accounting skills or are uneasy about chasing unpaid invoices.

Insurers without a plan for some form of chatbot pilot risk losing out as online advertising undergoes its next big step change.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Chatbots are the hottest customer-centric innovative technology of 2016 so far. In March,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2016\\/3\\/30\\/11332494\\/microsoft-bot-framework-build\\\">Microsoft<\\/a>&nbsp;announced the launch of a new platform that will enable anyone to build one. In April,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/04\\/12\\/agents-on-messenger\\/\\\">Facebook<\\/a>&nbsp;announced the launch of chatbots on its existing Messenger platform.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What are chatbots? At the most basic level, these are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate conversations with a real person.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>They have the obvious potential benefit of replacing customer service staff \\u2013 or freeing up those employees for other tasks, thus increasing productivity. But the marketing potential is even greater, as they enable companies to initiate conversations with customers online based on what sites they\\u2019re on and what kind of services they might be looking for.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Targeting new customers more effectively<\\/b>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In insurance, they could be used to replace the need to fill out long, tedious forms. Not only that, but since a chatbot can initiate a conversation, you can use them to proactively target prospective customers rather than wait for them to come to you. This is the vision behind Spixii, a startup we\\u2019ve been working with at InsurTech.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Spixii aims to make the buying of health and travel insurance more intuitive and fun for millennials, and to generate more revenues for insurers by opening up the relatively untapped millennial market \\u2013 and then upselling to these consumers in a more targeted and less pushy manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With Spixii, the chatbot acts you\\u2019re having an online conversation with a human insurance agent, asking you questions and responding to your answers. The consumer gets a more engaging experience than just filling out a form, while the insurer can carry out an accurate risk assessment.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Right now Spixii has several tier one insurers interested in partnering with them to run a pilot. They also have just been accepted on the Allianz Accelerator programme in France to test their offering further. Cynics may dismiss the technology as a gimmick. But no one can afford not to start experimenting with it, for one very simple reason: Facebook wants to supplant Google as the number one advertising platform on the internet, and they\\u2019re investing heavily in chatbots to help them do this.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Facebook is no longer a social media company \\u2013 here\\u2019s why that matters<\\/b>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.vox.com\\/2016\\/5\\/10\\/11640140\\/facebook-media-influence\\\">Facebook<\\/a>&nbsp;is no longer a social network. It\\u2019s a technology holding company just like Google, and it now comprises social media, photo-sharing (Instagram), messaging (WhatsApp) and virtual reality (Oculus). It\\u2019s also the largest media distributor in history.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The company has grown with one goal: to make it so that no one who uses the internet ever has to leave the Facebook platform. Once we reach \\u201cPeak Facebook\\u201d \\u2013 the point at which the majority of the world\\u2019s internet users spend all their internet time on one or other of Facebook\\u2019s apps \\u2013 it will become pointless to advertise anywhere else.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After all, Facebook already tales up 22% of the internet time that Americans spend on mobile devices, compared with 11% on Google search and YouTube combined. And Facebook\'s advertising revenues have more than doubled in the last two years, to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.economist.com\\/news\\/briefing\\/21696507-social-network-has-turned-itself-one-worlds-most-influential-technology-giants\\\">$18 billion in 2015<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>Chatbot failure is not an option<\\/b>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And why is Facebook so interested in chatbots? Because by creating its own advertising platform, it can control how people buy products and services online. Specifically, the company wants the whole transaction to take place within its own platform \\u2013 so customers never have to leave it. And hosting chatbots looks set to be one of the most effective ways of doing this.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now, this trend towards internet dominance may or may not pay off. And it certainly throws up some questions about the fact that Facebook could end up with complete control \\u2013 or at least de facto dominance \\u2013 over how companies can advertise to their consumers online. But Facebook\\u2019s growth has been so phenomenal, and its increasing influence so unstoppable, that running some kind of chatbot pilot is not something insurers can afford to see as a luxury. It\\u2019s a necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><b>How insurers can exploit this trend<\\/b>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The fastest way to trial your own chatbot is through partnerships and pilots \\u2013 either with technology companies themselves or with innovative startups who aim to solve a business problem that you\\u2019re struggling with.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To go back to the example of Spixii I mentioned before: this company represents an ideal opportunity for insurers to tap into the millennial market, and, in so doing, to investigate how the technology could be extended to reach other markets and develop attractive new propositions and products. Plus, it potentially offers a level of customer engagement and insight for small premium insurance products that just wouldn\\u2019t be affordable otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Facebook is serious about this technology. If successful, it could transform the world of online advertising beyond recognition. It may be that insurers can\\u2019t afford not to trial the technology, but those who are successful stand to reap huge potential rewards.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"}}', '2016-10-25 16:48:05', '2016-10-25 16:48:05', 'ca8a76f1-bfbf-4012-a0c0-d9c7f071bd90'),

They think: \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s three months away from product development. That\\u2019s difficult. I want to focus on the tech.\\u201d No, no, no, no! Spend three months really getting good at sales, at communicating, at branding, at messaging, building relationships. That is going to do so much more for you than building a great product because growth takes two things. It takes a great product, but it also takes a great sales strategy. Remember that there\\u2019s more to the equation than just the technology and really focus on this opportunity to develop relationships and competencies that are going to help you grow beyond the seed stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you see the venture capital model heading in five years?\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;I think a lot more people are excited about venture capital. A lot of people want to be investors. It\\u2019s like a sexy thing to do right now, which is great. I love it. The more money that goes into the ecosystem, the more ideas start getting thrown around.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What I think you\\u2019re seeing, though, is a decoupling of the size of the check that an investor\\u2019s able to write and the value that they\\u2019re able to add to an early stage company. We at DCG invest at the seed stage. We aim for 2% to 5% ownership, but we write smaller checks.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What you\\u2019re going to start to see are two different types of investors. You\\u2019re going to see one investor who\\u2019s really focused on network effects, on connectivity, who\\u2019s really focused on value-added services, and another investor that\\u2019s really focused on late stage growth. They\\u2019re going to play two very different roles within the life cycle of a startup.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;What advice would you have for companies who want to pitch DCG?\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp; For us, we\\u2019re seed stage investors. What our investing team looks at are three things. Number one, the team. Who are you? What\\u2019s your track record and what\\u2019s your story? Why are you starting this company? We need to see that you have grit and that you have determination and that you really care.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The second is product. Technically, what have you built? Open source software is notoriously competitive, so having teams that are technically competent is very important.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Then the last one is market. How do you think about monetization, and what\\u2019s the timeline on that? We\\u2019re different from most VCs in that we\\u2019re not a fund. We don\\u2019t have a certain timeline. If it\\u2019s going to take you 10 years to reach profitability, I think we\\u2019re okay with that, but you need to have a plan and then you need to have a backup plan and a backup plan to the backup plan.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the role of Community Manager, how do you see it evolving?\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started my role was pretty specific. It was focused on developing better connective tissue between our companies. Now that we have a number of strategic investors on board we started to realize the value of having a broad network. For me, it\\u2019s about building the DCG brand, building relationships, and also creating new opportunities and new ways of thinking around how to internalize innovation within a large organization. &nbsp;It\\u2019s about taking the community role, untangling into the various components that really move the needle and making it more of a discipline.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To read the full interview, please click<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.linkedin.com\\/pulse\\/my-interview-meltem-demirors-dcg-jesse-podell?published=t\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">&nbsp;here<\\/a>:\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Follow&nbsp;Meltem Demirors on <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/Melt_Dem\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Twitter<\\/a>\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;\\u2013\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/dcg.co\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Digital Currency Group&nbsp;<\\/a>manages a large early stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain space.

This focus on \\u2018intrapreneurship\\u2019 is seen through its annual internal innovation competition, A.C.E. This challenges employees to develop innovative ideas, rewarding winners with resources and funding to be incubated in one of the bank\\u2019s innovation centers, located in Palo Alto, Pittsburgh, London, New Jersey, Pune and Chennai. Innovation training further helps employees develop ideation skills, whilst a social collaboration platform allows employees to discuss new ideas they are working on and collaborate.&nbsp; \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>BNY Mellon\\u2019s focus on a cultural shift in mindset has begun to manifest itself in real technological innovation and competence.

The NEXEN Digital Ecosystem was developed by the bank as way to increase the speed of delivery and value to clients. NEXEN is an open sourced cloud based architecture that includes a methodology for developing API\\u2019s with one language and documentation. These API\\u2019s are available to the company\\u2019s developers and consumers through an API store where they can utilize the platform\\u2019s library to create new applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Previously, developers would create applications in their own language and with separate micro-code monitoring. Now they are able to quickly tie together applications via API and manage them in one cloud based management system. Because monitoring is built into the NEXEN system, all applications can be tracked and monitored in unison, allowing for greater data insights and more intelligent decision making.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This platform was made possible due to the Bank\\u2019s commitment to encouraging a mindset of innovation by directly addressing the breadth of change required at every level of the organization and getting strong sponsorship from executive levels.<\\/p><h1><br><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/bbva-open-talent-ganadores-europa-2016_0.jpg#asset:219\\\"><br><br>BBVA <\\/h1><p>BBVA\\u2019s Strategy and Innovation unit was created in 2007, as part of the Technology and Operations department, whose key objective was to integrate emerging technologies into the banking industry, resulting in projects such as ABIL, the first smart ATM. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>BBVA has turned to open innovation models in order to overcome existing challenges and attract the best talent.

This approach depends upon ecosystems for innovation and talent worldwide and seeks to foster a culture of collaboration with entrepreneurs, startups and developers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Innovation Centers generate ideas and accelerates these through a process of experimentation and prototyping. The value of this approach was demonstrated in 2008 when BBVA became one of the first banks in Europe to introduce online money management (PFM).\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Innovation Centers form hubs, points from which to engage with the wider FinTech ecosystem. BBVA has established an innovation network comprised of partners, such as tech giants Google, IBM, Cisco and Microsoft, as well as academic institutions, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford, commercial organizations, like Gartner and Continuum, and startups. This sharing of knowledge and ideas encourages cross-pollination and helps generate innovation for BBVA. &nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition, BBVA hosts the Open Talent Challenge, now in its 8###sup\\/sup### cycle. This global startup competition focuses on attracting innovative startups that are transforming financial services, offering the winner a place on a two-week Immersion and Interaction program. &nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Most recently, in February 2016 BBVA announced the closure of its in-house venture arm, BBVA Ventures. Instead, BBVA Venture\\u2019s portfolio, the $100 million allotted fund, and an additional $150 million, is being put into a new VC \\u2013 Propel Venture Partners - based in San Francisco and London. BBVA has become a limited partner in Propel and will focus on payments, credit, insurance, wealth management, e-commerce, and security & compliance. The move reflects BBVA\\u2019s belief that their increased capital, and Propel\\u2019s independence and London presence, will attract the best FinTech startups.&nbsp; \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/20151112_130526.jpg#asset:220\\\">&nbsp;<\\/p><h1>Santander<\\/h1><p>Santander engages in a wide range of complementary innovation activities. Most notably, Santander has launched Openbank, a fully digital bank, several Digital Labs, and InnoVentures, the bank\\u2019s venture capital arm with a FinTech focused fund of over $100 million.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>InnoVentures invests in FinTech startups that the fund believes can add value to the bank\\u2019s customers. This is wide ranging, covering everything from payments, alternative lending and personal finance management. The fund also selects investments based on the value that the bank can bring to the startup by introducing customers, helping to establish a strong position within the FinTech ecosystem. In addition to acting as an investment vehicle, InnoVentures serves as a funnel for startups and new technologies into Santander\\u2019s other innovation initiatives. Even if InnoVentures does not invest in a startup there is the opportunity to partner with them to explore new technology or specific use cases, through running pilots or proof of concepts. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\r\\n Openbank is another example of Santander\\u2019s multi layered approach. Serving the Spanish market, Openbank is a completely digital bank that operates under its own brand but is supported by Santander. As a completely digital bank, the venture offers a unique proposition to customers and is a standalone business. Openbank is not reliant on Santander\\u2019s central processes and legacy IT infrastructure creating additional value as an innovation initiative as startups\\u2019 technologies can be integrated much faster than with Santander itself.&nbsp;<br><br><br><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/Citibank_Chinatown.jpg#asset:222\\\"><\\/p><h1>Citi<\\/h1><p>Citi has developed a portfolio of initiatives; engaging both the external innovation ecosystem and creating internal initiatives to encourage new mindsets and ways of working.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Citi Ventures oversees a global network of labs and, in 2013, established an internal Acceleration Fund to encourage rapid experimentation and discovery. The labs allow Citi to pilot new solutions rapidly, search for disruptive business models and focus on emerging technologies, such as blockchain technology and crytpocurrencies. Citi prioritized these labs early on: in 2009 Citi\\u2019s Global Transaction Services business opened it global Research, Development, Innovation and Learning Centre in Dublin. At this time Citi announced an investment of $24 million for the development of a next generation intelligent payments solution bringing Citi\\u2019s total investment in research and development in Ireland to $100 million at that time. Citi has subsequently opened other centers in San Francisco, Israel and Singapore. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These labs play an important role in allowing Citi to connect its innovation teams with clients, employees and, industry experts. Through showcasing innovation initiatives and solutions, senior management, different business lines, and individuals are engaged with, and exposed to, innovative processes, solutions and mindsets. This is also seen with the Citi Ventures Catalyst program which engages Citi executives to share industry expertise, open conversations, and align strategic interests to help drive the company\\u2019s innovation agenda. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Citi runs multiple accelerator programs in order to engage with startups. Their FinTech accelerator was launched in Tel Aviv in 2013 as part of the Citi Innovation Lab TLV, within Citi\\u2019s global network of innovation centers. Since then, Citi have partnered with Plug and Play to further expand their accelerator programs and engage with FinTech startups. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition, Citi\\u2019s venture capital arm has grown their Investment portfolio to 23 active startups. Through aligning their investment focus with the core business\\u2019 needs: Big Data and Analytics, Commerce Payments, Financial Technology, Marketing and Customer Experience, and Security and Enterprise IT, Citi seeks to invest in cutting edge and highly relevant startups to drive innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-10-26 13:52:40', '2016-10-26 13:52:40', '4315d54d-c421-4a9f-ab18-247803652465'),

This focus on \\u2018intrapreneurship\\u2019 is seen through its annual internal innovation competition, A.C.E. This challenges employees to develop innovative ideas, rewarding winners with resources and funding to be incubated in one of the bank\\u2019s innovation centers, located in Palo Alto, Pittsburgh, London, New Jersey, Pune and Chennai. Innovation training further helps employees develop ideation skills, whilst a social collaboration platform allows employees to discuss new ideas they are working on and collaborate.&nbsp; \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>BNY Mellon\\u2019s focus on a cultural shift in mindset has begun to manifest itself in real technological innovation and competence. The bank\\u2019s IT departments have adopted agile development practices involving small teams that take a continuous delivery approach to development, rolling out frequent production updates and reducing delivery time. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Further encouraging an innovative culture, the IT department has increased its ability to collaborate by sharing resources and knowledge across the entire organization. The NEXEN Digital Ecosystem was developed by the bank as way to increase the speed of delivery and value to clients. NEXEN is an open sourced cloud based architecture that includes a methodology for developing API\\u2019s with one language and documentation. These API\\u2019s are available to the company\\u2019s developers and consumers through an API store where they can utilize the platform\\u2019s library to create new applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Previously, developers would create applications in their own language and with separate micro-code monitoring. Now they are able to quickly tie together applications via API and manage them in one cloud based management system. Because monitoring is built into the NEXEN system, all applications can be tracked and monitored in unison, allowing for greater data insights and more intelligent decision making.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This platform was made possible due to the Bank\\u2019s commitment to encouraging a mindset of innovation by directly addressing the breadth of change required at every level of the organization and getting strong sponsorship from executive levels.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1><br><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/bbva-open-talent-ganadores-europa-2016_0.jpg#asset:219:url\\\" alt=\\\"bbva-open-talent-ganadores-europa-2016_0\\\"><br><br>BBVA <\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>BBVA\\u2019s Strategy and Innovation unit was created in 2007, as part of the Technology and Operations department, whose key objective was to integrate emerging technologies into the banking industry, resulting in projects such as ABIL, the first smart ATM. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>BBVA has turned to open innovation models in order to overcome existing challenges and attract the best talent. BBVA has opened Innovation Centers, such as those in Madrid (Spain) and Bogota (Colombia), and focused on developing a knowledge network around these. This approach depends upon ecosystems for innovation and talent worldwide and seeks to foster a culture of collaboration with entrepreneurs, startups and developers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Innovation Centers generate ideas and accelerates these through a process of experimentation and prototyping. The value of this approach was demonstrated in 2008 when BBVA became one of the first banks in Europe to introduce online money management (PFM).\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Innovation Centers form hubs, points from which to engage with the wider FinTech ecosystem. BBVA has established an innovation network comprised of partners, such as tech giants Google, IBM, Cisco and Microsoft, as well as academic institutions, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford, commercial organizations, like Gartner and Continuum, and startups. This sharing of knowledge and ideas encourages cross-pollination and helps generate innovation for BBVA. &nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition, BBVA hosts the Open Talent Challenge, now in its 8###sup\\/sup### cycle. This global startup competition focuses on attracting innovative startups that are transforming financial services, offering the winner a place on a two-week Immersion and Interaction program. &nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Most recently, in February 2016 BBVA announced the closure of its in-house venture arm, BBVA Ventures. Instead, BBVA Venture\\u2019s portfolio, the $100 million allotted fund, and an additional $150 million, is being put into a new VC \\u2013 Propel Venture Partners - based in San Francisco and London. BBVA has become a limited partner in Propel and will focus on payments, credit, insurance, wealth management, e-commerce, and security & compliance. The move reflects BBVA\\u2019s belief that their increased capital, and Propel\\u2019s independence and London presence, will attract the best FinTech startups.&nbsp; \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/20151112_130526.jpg#asset:220:url\\\" alt=\\\"20151112_130526.jpg#asset:220\\\">&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>Santander<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Santander engages in a wide range of complementary innovation activities. Most notably, Santander has launched Openbank, a fully digital bank, several Digital Labs, and InnoVentures, the bank\\u2019s venture capital arm with a FinTech focused fund of over $100 million.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>InnoVentures invests in FinTech startups that the fund believes can add value to the bank\\u2019s customers. This is wide ranging, covering everything from payments, alternative lending and personal finance management.

They also need to connect the internal and external innovation efforts. If you just take startup engagement for instance; startups come in different stages and they have different needs and also different benefits for the organization. So, you can be part of an accelerator to see very early stage startups, to get excited by the the spirit and the drive and the passion of entrepreneurs, but also just to see the very latest trends. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When it comes to using real technology that has been built by startups then you have to look at something that is maybe a little bit more advanced, maybe a little bit more mature, but that engagement has to be different. Maybe it\'s more like a managed lab, maybe it\'s trying to find ways of incorporating the technology into the business. And this is something that often happens by exploring. By using something like a startup studio, something like a separate entity, separate organization, that is bringing people together with startup experience and putting them together with project people from the organization who know about the business. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The interesting thing in this new and evolving landscape is that organizations still sometimes cling on to the idea of \\u201cwe have to do everything ourselves,\\u201d and the smarter organizations recognize that there\'s certain things that you cannot do as a bank, as an insurer, as a large corporate by yourself. Because you don\'t have the know how, you don\'t have the expertise; but also, when It comes to collaboration, which is really important in this space, you usually cannot easily collaborate, by yourself, with other parties. So, having a neutral organization, having somebody like a startupbootcamp who would come in the middle, who brings people around the table and gets them to openly share their challenges, share their problems and priorities, and get them to jointly engage with startups is something that we\'ve seen being very successful.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"}}', '2016-10-27 09:01:30', '2016-10-27 09:01:30', '2b1aa1a6-e7d5-4cad-8781-6eb220a0a648'),

This focus on \\u2018intrapreneurship\\u2019 is seen through its annual internal innovation competition, A.C.E. This challenges employees to develop innovative ideas, rewarding winners with resources and funding to be incubated in one of the bank\\u2019s innovation centers, located in Palo Alto, Pittsburgh, London, New Jersey, Pune and Chennai. Innovation training further helps employees develop ideation skills, whilst a social collaboration platform allows employees to discuss new ideas they are working on and collaborate.&nbsp; \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>BNY Mellon\\u2019s focus on a cultural shift in mindset has begun to manifest itself in real technological innovation and competence. The bank\\u2019s IT departments have adopted agile development practices involving small teams that take a continuous delivery approach to development, rolling out frequent production updates and reducing delivery time. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Further encouraging an innovative culture, the IT department has increased its ability to collaborate by sharing resources and knowledge across the entire organization. The NEXEN Digital Ecosystem was developed by the bank as way to increase the speed of delivery and value to clients. NEXEN is an open sourced cloud based architecture that includes a methodology for developing API\\u2019s with one language and documentation. These API\\u2019s are available to the company\\u2019s developers and consumers through an API store where they can utilize the platform\\u2019s library to create new applications.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Previously, developers would create applications in their own language and with separate micro-code monitoring. Now they are able to quickly tie together applications via API and manage them in one cloud based management system. Because monitoring is built into the NEXEN system, all applications can be tracked and monitored in unison, allowing for greater data insights and more intelligent decision making.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This platform was made possible due to the Bank\\u2019s commitment to encouraging a mindset of innovation by directly addressing the breadth of change required at every level of the organization and getting strong sponsorship from executive levels.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1><br><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/bbva-open-talent-ganadores-europa-2016_0.jpg#asset:219:url\\\" alt=\\\"bbva-open-talent-ganadores-europa-2016_0\\\"><br><br>BBVA <\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>BBVA\\u2019s Strategy and Innovation unit was created in 2007, as part of the Technology and Operations department, whose key objective was to integrate emerging technologies into the banking industry, resulting in projects such as ABIL, the first smart ATM. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>BBVA has turned to open innovation models in order to overcome existing challenges and attract the best talent. BBVA has opened Innovation Centers, such as those in Madrid (Spain) and Bogota (Colombia), and focused on developing a knowledge network around these. This approach depends upon ecosystems for innovation and talent worldwide and seeks to foster a culture of collaboration with entrepreneurs, startups and developers.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Innovation Centers generate ideas and accelerates these through a process of experimentation and prototyping. The value of this approach was demonstrated in 2008 when BBVA became one of the first banks in Europe to introduce online money management (PFM).\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Innovation Centers form hubs, points from which to engage with the wider FinTech ecosystem. BBVA has established an innovation network comprised of partners, such as tech giants Google, IBM, Cisco and Microsoft, as well as academic institutions, like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Stanford, commercial organizations, like Gartner and Continuum, and startups. This sharing of knowledge and ideas encourages cross-pollination and helps generate innovation for BBVA. &nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition, BBVA hosts the Open Talent Challenge, now in its 8###sup\\/sup### cycle.

Instead, BBVA Venture\\u2019s portfolio, the $100 million allotted fund, and an additional $150 million, is being put into a new VC \\u2013 Propel Venture Partners - based in San Francisco and London. BBVA has become a limited partner in Propel and will focus on payments, credit, insurance, wealth management, e-commerce, and security & compliance. The move reflects BBVA\\u2019s belief that their increased capital, and Propel\\u2019s independence and London presence, will attract the best FinTech startups.&nbsp; \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/20151112_130526.jpg#asset:220:url\\\" alt=\\\"20151112_130526.jpg#asset:220\\\">&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>Santander<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Santander engages in a wide range of complementary innovation activities.

This is wide ranging, covering everything from payments, alternative lending and personal finance management. The fund also selects investments based on the value that the bank can bring to the startup by introducing customers, helping to establish a strong position within the FinTech ecosystem. In addition to acting as an investment vehicle, InnoVentures serves as a funnel for startups and new technologies into Santander\\u2019s other innovation initiatives. Even if InnoVentures does not invest in a startup there is the opportunity to partner with them to explore new technology or specific use cases, through running pilots or proof of concepts. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\r\\n Openbank is another example of Santander\\u2019s multi layered approach. Serving the Spanish market, Openbank is a completely digital bank that operates under its own brand but is supported by Santander. As a completely digital bank, the venture offers a unique proposition to customers and is a standalone business. Openbank is not reliant on Santander\\u2019s central processes and legacy IT infrastructure creating additional value as an innovation initiative as startups\\u2019 technologies can be integrated much faster than with Santander itself.&nbsp;<br><br><br><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/Citibank_Chinatown.jpg#asset:222:url\\\" alt=\\\"Citibank_Chinatown.jpg#asset:222\\\"><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>Citi<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Citi has developed a portfolio of initiatives; engaging both the external innovation ecosystem and creating internal initiatives to encourage new mindsets and ways of working.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Citi Ventures oversees a global network of labs and, in 2013, established an internal Acceleration Fund to encourage rapid experimentation and discovery. The labs allow Citi to pilot new solutions rapidly, search for disruptive business models and focus on emerging technologies, such as blockchain technology and crytpocurrencies. Citi prioritized these labs early on: in 2009 Citi\\u2019s Global Transaction Services business opened it global Research, Development, Innovation and Learning Centre in Dublin. At this time Citi announced an investment of $24 million for the development of a next generation intelligent payments solution bringing Citi\\u2019s total investment in research and development in Ireland to $100 million at that time. Citi has subsequently opened other centers in San Francisco, Israel and Singapore. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These labs play an important role in allowing Citi to connect its innovation teams with clients, employees and, industry experts. Through showcasing innovation initiatives and solutions, senior management, different business lines, and individuals are engaged with, and exposed to, innovative processes, solutions and mindsets. This is also seen with the Citi Ventures Catalyst program which engages Citi executives to share industry expertise, open conversations, and align strategic interests to help drive the company\\u2019s innovation agenda. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Citi runs multiple accelerator programs in order to engage with startups. Their FinTech accelerator was launched in Tel Aviv in 2013 as part of the Citi Innovation Lab TLV, within Citi\\u2019s global network of innovation centers. Since then, Citi have partnered with Plug and Play to further expand their accelerator programs and engage with FinTech startups. \\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In addition, Citi\\u2019s venture capital arm has grown their Investment portfolio to 23 active startups. Through aligning their investment focus with the core business\\u2019 needs: Big Data and Analytics, Commerce Payments, Financial Technology, Marketing and Customer Experience, and Security and Enterprise IT, Citi seeks to invest in cutting edge and highly relevant startups to drive innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-10-27 09:41:15', '2016-10-27 09:41:15', '73abf913-f354-4d44-8dea-cf5bd87e17b7'),

That skill set cannot be underestimated. You\\u2019re going through this rigorous program that\\u2019s designed to teach you all of these fantastic skills and competencies, and you\\u2019re learning from some of the best corporate VCs, the best corporate strategists, the best VCs, the best startup mentors that you normally wouldn\\u2019t have access to in your network.

They think: \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s three months away from product development. That\\u2019s difficult. I want to focus on the tech.\\u201d No, no, no, no! Spend three months really getting good at sales, at communicating, at branding, at messaging, building relationships. That is going to do so much more for you than building a great product because growth takes two things. It takes a great product, but it also takes a great sales strategy. Remember that there\\u2019s more to the equation than just the technology and really focus on this opportunity to develop relationships and competencies that are going to help you grow beyond the seed stage.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you see the venture capital model heading in five years?\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;I think a lot more people are excited about venture capital. A lot of people want to be investors. It\\u2019s like a sexy thing to do right now, which is great. I love it. The more money that goes into the ecosystem, the more ideas start getting thrown around.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What I think you\\u2019re seeing, though, is a decoupling of the size of the check that an investor\\u2019s able to write and the value that they\\u2019re able to add to an early stage company. We at DCG invest at the seed stage. We aim for 2% to 5% ownership, but we write smaller checks.\\r\\n\\r\\n  <\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What you\\u2019re going to start to see are two different types of investors. You\\u2019re going to see one investor who\\u2019s really focused on network effects, on connectivity, who\\u2019s really focused on value-added services, and another investor that\\u2019s really focused on late stage growth.

What our investing team looks at are three things. Number one, the team. Who are you? What\\u2019s your track record and what\\u2019s your story? Why are you starting this company?

Major corporates are tuning their inhouse hierarchy to fit in \\u201cinnovation\\u201d in their culture, vision and value. To an extent that nowadays, there is a specific job title in major healthcare conglomerates called, \\u201cChief Innovation Officer\\u201d to build innovation cultures in the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So what exactly is an Innovation culture, and why is it suddenly a necessity? Let us explore this and its role specifically in the field of healthcare.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation Culture is a company environment chosen by the leaders to encourage and facilitate unorthodox ideas and strategies. In these companies, innovation is not just a privilege of the C-level, but employee at any level is encouraged to foster the culture and be innovative in their approach.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>So why is it suddenly a necessity?<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many companies working the traditional way for decades now suddenly are shifting towards innovation cultures. There are several factors contributing to this shift.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The primary reason for this shift is Digitalization. Digitalization has paced up the market, the customer has a strong voice and bad performance instantly gets bad reviews. Hence, the scope of error has reduced hugely, making it paramount for companies to invent new ways of customer satisfaction.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The second factor weighing in is the rise of startups. Startups are agile and flexible, they are not afraid to be different and to try a road not taken, because they have nothing to lose. Large corporates, on the other hand, have much to lose if they try something that is not a standard norm.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The third and the most crucial factor is the consumer market. Consumers have changed, trust is still valuable but so is creativity. Market models have changed and even the old and established market structures are undergoing a change. This makes innovation paramount.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>But what does innovation culture comprise of?<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation Culture is not a pet project, it is a style of thinking. It is not a creative inborn talent, it is a practiced skill. Which also means that there is not set way or rules to this culture, but every team builds its own culture. Here are some factors we see overlapping in all companies fostering Innovation Culture.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>1.Speed<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The need of innovation arises from fast &nbsp;changing market needs, hence shorter innovation cycles are paramount. Speculation over long time leads to slowness, the very evil corporations are trying to avoid. However, speed needs to come from quick decision making and clarity in vision, and not rash decisions.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>2.Digitalization<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Digitalization is one of the primary reasons behind the shift in markets. So it is imperative for corporates to not just add but make digitalization an integral part of their outreach plan. The consumer expects companies to fill gaps and be more service oriented, and digitalization is the fastest way to address this need.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>3. Open leadership<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While it is important for the company founders and leaders to value and encourage innovation cultures, in successful innovation culture implementation, lower management also believes and practices an open creative culture, as these are the people who function directly with execution and micro manage teams.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>4.Value in failure<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One reason why corporations fail at innovation is because they are risk averse. They are big and protecting the name becomes more and more important. But as one adopts innovation culture, one needs to learn the art of accepting failure. An interesting take is to call a Failure a \\u201cglitch\\u201d. While a failure sounds painfully permanent, a glitch sounds temporary, solvable and a learning opportunity.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>5.Sustaining innovation<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is a tough task to get your employees to embrace innovation culture, but it is equally important to get them to stay on course. It can not be just a one-project affair. To get employees to show innovativity in workplace, there can be rewards, from as big as a holiday to as tiny as sincere appreciation.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>6.Flat hierarchy<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Flat hierarchy is a fast-evolving management style that many companies are adopting. Some people call it Bossless Management, some call it Radical Management and some, Holacracy, but the core of the concept remains the same. The concept does away with leadership\\u2019s sole decision making power and gives the power to the collective intelligence of all employees. One good example of Holacracy is&nbsp;###a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/searchcio.techtarget.com\\/feature\\/Flap-over-Zappos-holacracy-puts-spotlight-on-bossless-workplace\\\"&gt;Zappos, one of the largest companies to have adopted bossless administration.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>All innovative companies have different missions, but their processes are similar. They encourage unorthodox methods that include speed, flexibility, adaptation of digital technology, flat hierarchies and sustainable innovation.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-10-27 10:06:47', '2016-10-27 10:06:47', '848e07f7-870a-43b9-abae-51120d9e7afb'),

But they struggle to be useful if certain startups aren\\u2019t given the resources to test their products, properly. What incentives can you give traditional firms to invite them into the sandbox to support startups to co-create industry-changing products? What procedures can you put in place to make sure co-creation is not only beneficial to startups, incumbents firms but to the regulatory process itself?\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>Playing in the sandbox,&nbsp;<\\/i>will be an interactive, think tank style roundtable where you can hear from industry experts to debate and discuss the current state of the industry as well as future trends with your peers.\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Please join us at the Rainmaking Loft to be a part of this series of thought provoking Rainmaking Sessions, trends that are shaping our industry.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You will hear from:&nbsp;\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul><li>Anna Wallace,&nbsp;Manager, Innovation Hub at the Financial Conduct Authority\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/li><li>Jon Pearson, London Lab Manager, Deutsche Bank Labs\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Agenda:\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul><li>8:15 - Arrival at loft for coffee\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/li><li>8:30 \\u2013 Buffet style breakfast served\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/li><li>8:45 - Welcome and talks begin\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/li><li>9:15 - Moderated Roundtable starts\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/li><li>10:30 - Breakfast Roundtable ends\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Spaces are limited, so please register with EventBrite for your chance to be a part of this special event.\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once you reserve your place, please shout about your attendance by sharing \\u2018I will be adding my views and insights to the #RainmakingSessions on&nbsp;<i>Playing in the sandbox on 11&nbsp;<\\/i>October!\\u2019 on your social media channels.\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Rainmaking Sessions\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><i>The Rainmaking Sessions<\\/i><i>&nbsp;are series of monthly, breakfast roundtables to foster debate, discussion and discourse on the nature of innovation in corporates, FinTech, InsurTech, Digital Health and Smart Transportation.<\\/i>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<\\/p>\",\"23\":\"https:\\/\\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\\/e\\/playing-in-the-sandbox-tickets-27541673888\",\"73\":[\"104\"],\"24\":\"Rainmaking Loft - London\",\"26\":{\"date\":\"10\\/11\\/2016\",\"time\":\"8:00 AM\"}}}', '2016-10-27 10:36:53', '2016-10-27 10:36:53', '0d2755f1-f9ab-4e1f-8741-a570c4b7dcd9'),

Major corporates are tuning their inhouse hierarchy to fit in \\u201cinnovation\\u201d in their culture, vision and value. To an extent that nowadays, there is a specific job title in major healthcare conglomerates called, \\u201cChief Innovation Officer\\u201d to build innovation cultures in the company.<\\/p><p>So what exactly is an Innovation culture, and why is it suddenly a necessity? Let us explore this and its role specifically in the field of healthcare.<\\/p><p>Innovation Culture is a company environment chosen by the leaders to encourage and facilitate unorthodox ideas and strategies. In these companies, innovation is not just a privilege of the C-level, but employee at any level is encouraged to foster the culture and be innovative in their approach.<\\/p><h1>So why is it suddenly a necessity?<\\/h1><p>Many companies working the traditional way for decades now suddenly are shifting towards innovation cultures. There are several factors contributing to this shift.<\\/p><p><span><\\/span>The primary reason for this shift is Digitalization. Digitalization has paced up the market, the customer has a strong voice and bad performance instantly gets bad reviews. Hence, the scope of error has reduced hugely, making it paramount for companies to invent new ways of customer satisfaction.<\\/p><p>The second factor weighing in is the rise of startups. Startups are agile and flexible, they are not afraid to be different and to try a road not taken, because they have nothing to lose. Large corporates, on the other hand, have much to lose if they try something that is not a standard norm.<\\/p><p>The third and the most crucial factor is the consumer market. Consumers have changed, trust is still valuable but so is creativity. Market models have changed and even the old and established market structures are undergoing a change. This makes innovation paramount.<\\/p><h1>But what does innovation culture comprise of?<\\/h1><p>Innovation Culture is not a pet project, it is a style of thinking. It is not a creative inborn talent, it is a practiced skill. Which also means that there is not set way or rules to this culture, but every team builds its own culture. Here are some factors we see overlapping in all companies fostering Innovation Culture.<\\/p><h2>1.Speed<\\/h2><p>The need of innovation arises from fast &nbsp;changing market needs, hence shorter innovation cycles are paramount. Speculation over long time leads to slowness, the very evil corporations are trying to avoid. However, speed needs to come from quick decision making and clarity in vision, and not rash decisions.<\\/p><h2>2.Digitalization<\\/h2><p>Digitalization is one of the primary reasons behind the shift in markets. So it is imperative for corporates to not just add but make digitalization an integral part of their outreach plan.

Now, if you were sitting in your car waiting in traffic this morning, you might be thinking, \\u201cyeah, right\\u201d. Though if your car is not the only way you travel, you might have experienced the changes for yourself. In European cities such as Berlin, alternative urban mobility services such as car sharing have&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/files.lsecities.net\\/files\\/2015\\/09\\/New-Urban-Mobility-London-and-Berlin.pdf\\\">decreased the dominance<\\/a>&nbsp;of car ownership as the main method of urban transportation.&nbsp;<\\/p><p>Car2go, Uber and apps like ally are just three examples of such services that are changing the way we get from A to B. That is not to say that car ownership is no longer significant. Indeed&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/files.lsecities.net\\/files\\/2015\\/09\\/New-Urban-Mobility-London-and-Berlin.pdf\\\">73% of households<\\/a>&nbsp;in Berlin still own at least one car. Needless to say, if the shift from car ownership to mobility services is inevitable, we still have a long way to go. There are, however, trends that are spurring on this shift. We\\u2019ll take a closer look at three of them: smartphone adoption, urbanization, and \\u201caccess over ownership\\u201d.<\\/p><h1>Smartphone Adoption<\\/h1><p>In Germany, the use of mobile devices to access the internet on the go is on the rise. According to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.emarketer.com\\/Article\\/Germany-Posts-Big-Increase-Mobile-Internet-Use\\/1011884#sthash.vNbOGCYz.dpuf\\\">data&nbsp;from emarketer<\\/a>, in 2015 54% of residents used their smartphone to access the Internet in comparison to 40% in 2013.

The further adoption of smartphones will likely lead to an increase in the use of new mobility services and provide an opportunity for businesses and other stakeholders to use this platform to create new technology.<\\/p><h1>Urbanization<\\/h1><p>Urbanization is a global megatrend.&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.cia.gov\\/library\\/publications\\/the-world-factbook\\/geos\\/gm.html\\\">Over 75% of the population<\\/a>&nbsp;of Germany lives in cities and it is estimated that by 2030,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.cinum.org\\/en\\/urbanisation-mobility\\/88-90-114.html\\\">60% of the world\\u2019s population<\\/a>&nbsp;will live in cities. Combine this with the trend that people are spending more time in transit, and it becomes clear that municipal governments have a major challenge on their hands.<\\/p><p><span><\\/span>Their job will be to improve quality of life in denser cities. Due to this charging urban environment, car ownership will become increasingly difficult to support. The risks ranging from worsening air pollution to traffic congestion are incredibly high if municipal governments aren\\u2019t open to, and supportive of, mobility options outside of what we are already accustomed to. In addition to changes in public policy, we will also likely see city residents taking initiative and altering their mobility habits as a result of the changes to urban life.

Major corporates are tuning their inhouse hierarchy to fit in \\u201cinnovation\\u201d in their culture, vision and value. To an extent that nowadays, there is a specific job title in major healthcare conglomerates called, \\u201cChief Innovation Officer\\u201d to build innovation cultures in the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So what exactly is an Innovation culture, and why is it suddenly a necessity? Let us explore this and its role specifically in the field of healthcare.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation Culture is a company environment chosen by the leaders to encourage and facilitate unorthodox ideas and strategies. In these companies, innovation is not just a privilege of the C-level, but employee at any level is encouraged to foster the culture and be innovative in their approach.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>So why is it suddenly a necessity?<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many companies working the traditional way for decades now suddenly are shifting towards innovation cultures. There are several factors contributing to this shift.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The primary reason for this shift is Digitalization. Digitalization has paced up the market, the customer has a strong voice and bad performance instantly gets bad reviews. Hence, the scope of error has reduced hugely, making it paramount for companies to invent new ways of customer satisfaction.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The second factor weighing in is the rise of startups. Startups are agile and flexible, they are not afraid to be different and to try a road not taken, because they have nothing to lose. Large corporates, on the other hand, have much to lose if they try something that is not a standard norm.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The third and the most crucial factor is the consumer market. Consumers have changed, trust is still valuable but so is creativity. Market models have changed and even the old and established market structures are undergoing a change. This makes innovation paramount.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>But what does innovation culture comprise of?<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation Culture is not a pet project, it is a style of thinking. It is not a creative inborn talent, it is a practiced skill. Which also means that there is not set way or rules to this culture, but every team builds its own culture. Here are some factors we see overlapping in all companies fostering Innovation Culture.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>1.&nbsp;Speed<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The need of innovation arises from fast &nbsp;changing market needs, hence shorter innovation cycles are paramount. Speculation over long time leads to slowness, the very evil corporations are trying to avoid. However, speed needs to come from quick decision making and clarity in vision, and not rash decisions.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Digitalization<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Digitalization is one of the primary reasons behind the shift in markets. So it is imperative for corporates to not just add but make digitalization an integral part of their outreach plan. The consumer expects companies to fill gaps and be more service oriented, and digitalization is the fastest way to address this need.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>3. Open leadership<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While it is important for the company founders and leaders to value and encourage innovation cultures, in successful innovation culture implementation, lower management also believes and practices an open creative culture, as these are the people who function directly with execution and micro manage teams.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Value in failure<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One reason why corporations fail at innovation is because they are risk averse. They are big and protecting the name becomes more and more important. But as one adopts innovation culture, one needs to learn the art of accepting failure. An interesting take is to call a Failure a \\u201cglitch\\u201d. While a failure sounds painfully permanent, a glitch sounds temporary, solvable and a learning opportunity.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Sustaining innovation<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is a tough task to get your employees to embrace innovation culture, but it is equally important to get them to stay on course. It can not be just a one-project affair. To get employees to show innovativity in workplace, there can be rewards, from as big as a holiday to as tiny as sincere appreciation.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>6.&nbsp;Flat hierarchy<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Flat hierarchy is a fast-evolving management style that many companies are adopting.

They get very excited, they also feel a lot of pressure to do something and then they randomly do things.<\\/p><p>One of the trends that we see, is organizations recognizing that working with startups is one channel but building products startup style is another, so the trend is really focusing on closing that loop. That\'s one of the things we see, the other one is really diversification. So, looking at innovation, not a box ticking exercise, but it\'s something that has to have many different iterations and many different facets.<\\/p><p>On the positive side, we see organizations trying a variety of different things; setting up their own investment funds, working with accelerators, doing their own incubation initiatives, having very structured programs for themselves. But also, putting a lot of effort into internal innovation initiatives by educating people about change, by giving them the opportunity to see other ways of working by giving them the opportunity to collaborate with competitors.<\\/p><p>The smart organizations recognize that they need to do multiple things at the same time and they need to allow themselves to fail. They also need to connect the internal and external innovation efforts. If you just take startup engagement for instance; startups come in different stages and they have different needs and also different benefits for the organization. So, you can be part of an accelerator to see very early stage startups, to get excited by the the spirit and the drive and the passion of entrepreneurs, but also just to see the very latest trends.<\\/p><p>When it comes to using real technology that has been built by startups then you have to look at something that is maybe a little bit more advanced, maybe a little bit more mature, but that engagement has to be different. Maybe it\'s more like a managed lab, maybe it\'s trying to find ways of incorporating the technology into the business. And this is something that often happens by exploring. By using something like a startup studio, something like a separate entity, separate organization, that is bringing people together with startup experience and putting them together with project people from the organization who know about the business.<\\/p><p>The interesting thing in this new and evolving landscape is that organizations still sometimes cling on to the idea of \\u201cwe have to do everything ourselves,\\u201d and the smarter organizations recognize that there\'s certain things that you cannot do as a bank, as an insurer, as a large corporate by yourself. Because you don\'t have the know how, you don\'t have the expertise; but also, when It comes to collaboration, which is really important in this space, you usually cannot easily collaborate, by yourself, with other parties. So, having a neutral organization, having somebody like a startupbootcamp who would come in the middle, who brings people around the table and gets them to openly share their challenges, share their problems and priorities, and get them to jointly engage with startups is something that we\'ve seen being very successful.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-10-31 12:19:33', '2016-10-31 12:19:33', '8fe277a9-5094-4258-b21e-419f26c658b5'),

The NEXEN Digital Ecosystem was developed by the bank as way to increase the speed of delivery and value to clients.

You\\u2019re going through this rigorous program that\\u2019s designed to teach you all of these fantastic skills and competencies, and you\\u2019re learning from some of the best corporate VCs, the best corporate strategists, the best VCs, the best startup mentors that you normally wouldn\\u2019t have access to in your network. It\\u2019s a great way to compress that learning in a really short timeline and to really grow your network and also get great PR. No brainer for me.<\\/p><p>Obviously, we\\u2019re super excited to have Startupbootcamp FinTech here and really excited about the startups that will go through your program.<\\/p><p>Jesse: &nbsp;What\\u2019s your general advice for startups who might be applying for an accelerator?<\\/p><p>Meltem:&nbsp;I think people are always a little hesitant about applying. They think: \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s three months away from product development. That\\u2019s difficult. I want to focus on the tech.\\u201d No, no, no, no! Spend three months really getting good at sales, at communicating, at branding, at messaging, building relationships. That is going to do so much more for you&nbsp;than building a great product because growth takes two things. It takes a great product, but it also takes a great sales strategy. Remember that there\\u2019s more to the equation than just the technology and really focus on this opportunity to develop relationships and competencies that are going to help you grow beyond the seed stage.<\\/p><p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you see the venture capital model heading in five years?<\\/p><p>Meltem:&nbsp;I think a lot more people are excited about venture capital. A lot of people want to be investors. It\\u2019s like a sexy thing to do right now, which is great. I love it. The more money that goes into the ecosystem, the more ideas start getting thrown around.<\\/p><p>What I think you\\u2019re seeing, though, is a decoupling of the size of the check that an investor\\u2019s able to write and the value that they\\u2019re able to add to an early stage company. We at DCG invest at the seed stage. We aim for 2% to 5% ownership, but we write smaller cheques.<\\/p><p>What you\\u2019re going to start to see are two different types of investors. You\\u2019re going to see one investor who\\u2019s really focused on network effects, on connectivity, who\\u2019s really focused on value-added services, and another investor that\\u2019s really focused on late stage growth. They\\u2019re going to play two very different roles within the life cycle of a startup.<\\/p><p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;What advice would you have for companies who want to pitch DCG?<\\/p><p>Meltem:&nbsp; For us, we\\u2019re seed stage investors. What our investing team looks at are three things. Number one, the team. Who are you? What\\u2019s your track record and what\\u2019s your story? Why are you starting this company? We need to see that you have grit and that you have determination and that you really care.<\\/p><p>The second is product. Technically, what have you built? Open source software is notoriously competitive, so having teams that are technically competent is very important.<\\/p><p>Then the last one is market. How do you think about monetization, and what\\u2019s the timeline on that? We\\u2019re different from most VCs in that we\\u2019re not a fund. We don\\u2019t have a certain timeline. If it\\u2019s going to take you 10 years to reach profitability, I think we\\u2019re okay with that, but you need to have a plan and then you need to have a backup plan and a backup plan to the backup plan.<\\/p><p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the role of Community Manager, how do you see it evolving?<\\/p><p>Meltem:&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started my role was pretty specific. It was focused on developing better connective tissue between our companies. Now that we have a number of strategic investors on board we started to realize the value of having a broad network. For me, it\\u2019s about building the DCG brand, building relationships, and also creating new opportunities and new ways of thinking around how to internalize innovation within a large organization. &nbsp;It\\u2019s about taking the community role, untangling into the various components that really move the needle and making it more of a discipline.<\\/p><p>To read the full interview, please click<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.linkedin.com\\/pulse\\/my-interview-meltem-demirors-dcg-jesse-podell?published=t\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">&nbsp;here<\\/a>:<\\/p><p>Follow&nbsp;Meltem Demirors on <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/Melt_Dem\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Twitter<\\/a><\\/p><p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/Melt_Dem\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><\\/a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;\\u2013<\\/p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/dcg.co\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Digital Currency Group&nbsp;<\\/a>manages a large early stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain space.

Insurers without a plan for some form of chatbot pilot risk losing out as online advertising undergoes its next big step change.<\\/p><p>Chatbots are the hottest customer-centric innovative technology of 2016 so far. In March,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2016\\/3\\/30\\/11332494\\/microsoft-bot-framework-build\\\">Microsoft<\\/a>&nbsp;announced the launch of a new platform that will enable anyone to build one. In April,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/04\\/12\\/agents-on-messenger\\/\\\">Facebook<\\/a>&nbsp;announced the launch of chatbots on its existing Messenger platform.<\\/p><p>What are chatbots? At the most basic level, these are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate conversations with a real person.<\\/p><p>They have the obvious potential benefit of replacing customer service staff \\u2013 or freeing up those employees for other tasks, thus increasing productivity. But the marketing potential is even greater, as they enable companies to initiate conversations with customers online based on what sites they\\u2019re on and what kind of services they might be looking for.<\\/p><p><strong>Targeting new customers more effectively<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong><\\/strong>In insurance, they could be used to replace the need to fill out long, tedious forms. Not only that, but since a chatbot can initiate a conversation, you can use them to proactively target prospective customers rather than wait for them to come to you. This is the vision behind Spixii, a startup we\\u2019ve been working with at InsurTech.<\\/p><p>Spixii aims to make the buying of health and travel insurance more intuitive and fun for millennials, and to generate more revenues for insurers by opening up the relatively untapped millennial market \\u2013 and then upselling to these consumers in a more targeted and less pushy manner.<\\/p><p>With Spixii, the chatbot acts you\\u2019re having an online conversation with a human insurance agent, asking you questions and responding to your answers. The consumer gets a more engaging experience than just filling out a form, while the insurer can carry out an accurate risk assessment.<\\/p><p>Right now Spixii has several tier one insurers interested in partnering with them to run a pilot. They also have just been accepted on the Allianz Accelerator programme in France to test their offering further. Cynics may dismiss the technology as a gimmick. But no one can afford not to start experimenting with it, for one very simple reason: Facebook wants to supplant Google as the number one advertising platform on the internet, and they\\u2019re investing heavily in chatbots to help them do this.<\\/p><p><strong>Facebook is no longer a social media company \\u2013 here\\u2019s why that matters<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong><\\/strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.vox.com\\/2016\\/5\\/10\\/11640140\\/facebook-media-influence\\\">Facebook<\\/a>&nbsp;is no longer a social network. It\\u2019s a technology holding company just like Google, and it now comprises social media, photo-sharing (Instagram), messaging (WhatsApp) and virtual reality (Oculus). It\\u2019s also the largest media distributor in history.<\\/p><p>The company has grown with one goal: to make it so that no one who uses the internet ever has to leave the Facebook platform. Once we reach \\u201cPeak Facebook\\u201d \\u2013 the point at which the majority of the world\\u2019s internet users spend all their internet time on one or other of Facebook\\u2019s apps \\u2013 it will become pointless to advertise anywhere else.<\\/p><p>After all, Facebook already tales up 22% of the internet time that Americans spend on mobile devices, compared with 11% on Google search and YouTube combined. And Facebook\'s advertising revenues have more than doubled in the last two years, to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.economist.com\\/news\\/briefing\\/21696507-social-network-has-turned-itself-one-worlds-most-influential-technology-giants\\\">$18 billion in 2015<\\/a>.<\\/p><p><strong>Chatbot failure is not an option<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong><\\/strong>And why is Facebook so interested in chatbots? Because by creating its own advertising platform, it can control how people buy products and services online. Specifically, the company wants the whole transaction to take place within its own platform \\u2013 so customers never have to leave it. And hosting chatbots looks set to be one of the most effective ways of doing this.<\\/p><p>Now, this trend towards internet dominance may or may not pay off. And it certainly throws up some questions about the fact that Facebook could end up with complete control \\u2013 or at least de facto dominance \\u2013 over how companies can advertise to their consumers online. But Facebook\\u2019s growth has been so phenomenal, and its increasing influence so unstoppable, that running some kind of chatbot pilot is not something insurers can afford to see as a luxury. It\\u2019s a necessity.<\\/p><p><strong>How insurers can exploit this trend<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong><\\/strong>The fastest way to trial your own chatbot is through partnerships and pilots \\u2013 either with technology companies themselves or with innovative startups who aim to solve a business problem that you\\u2019re struggling with.<\\/p><p>To go back to the example of Spixii I mentioned before: this company represents an ideal opportunity for insurers to tap into the millennial market, and, in so doing, to investigate how the technology could be extended to reach other markets and develop attractive new propositions and products. Plus, it potentially offers a level of customer engagement and insight for small premium insurance products that just wouldn\\u2019t be affordable otherwise.<\\/p><p>Facebook is serious about this technology. If successful, it could transform the world of online advertising beyond recognition. It may be that insurers can\\u2019t afford not to trial the technology, but those who are successful stand to reap huge potential rewards.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-10-31 13:28:10', '2016-10-31 13:28:10', 'a218b4ad-6031-48e3-9063-4c727c3fb6f9'),

The session looked at the establishment of the Regulatory Sandbox run by the Financial Conduct Authority and the appetite and capability of many incumbent banks to participate in the new scheme and partner with new entrants to the financial services landscape.<\\/p><p>The outcome? There are many footprints in the sandbox, but many may have to wait some time for impressive castles to be built.<\\/p><p>The FCA\\u2019s Regulatory Sandbox is meant to be a legal framework or a \\u2018safe space\\u2019 where businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms. This is a progressive step for startups in regulated industries, like financial services. However, many young companies still need active partnerships with established banks, firms and other corporates in order to test developing products with live data, enterprise architecture and an active customer base.<\\/p><p>Sandboxes, like the one set up by the FCA in the UK, are a step in the right direction for regulated industries. But they struggle to be useful if certain startups aren\\u2019t given the resources to test their products, properly.<\\/p><p>The FCA sandbox was designed to allow for collaboration. Currently, there are many FinTech startups involved in the programme. The FCA does not make public the names or the number of startups participating in the sandbox. However, many of these companies still require participation from incumbent banks in order to adequately test their offerings in the safe legal framework the FCA has established.<\\/p><p>However many banks, themselves, are working on creating their own innovation labs to not only support and welcome new technology and services entrants, but to enable and empower their own internal staff to embrace innovation. Many in this industry know that incumbent banks and financial services firms move at a pace considered much slower than is enjoyed in the Silicon Valley-style startup world. This is true even for banks that are working towards creating a more agile and flexible work environment.<\\/p><p>The window of opportunity is open now to work within the FCA Regulatory Sandbox.

As the group munched on bacon rolls and sipped tea and coffee, all were in the room with the understanding that small to medium sized businesses are a group that is under loved, underserved and ripe with opportunity.<\\/p><p>The roundtable discussion, led by Justin Hannemann, Head of Product Experience (Customer and Innovation), Santander UK and Johanna Pugh, global head of Lending, Misys caused several themes to emerge from the table.<\\/p><p>SMEs are quite diverse and can range from everything from a tech-savvy FinTech startup in London to a cat grooming store in Sheffield, for example. This makes SMEs hard to classify and are seen as risky and complex by banks. Categorisation is hard when <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.thecompanywarehouse.co.uk\\/2012\\/07\\/31\\/what-is-an-sme\\/\\\">definitions differ<\\/a> between UK government departments, HMRC and even the EU. As banks enhance their services to retail customers and larger commercial organisations, SMEs get pushed to the bottom.<\\/p><p>Internal bank politics as well as legacy systems don\\u2019t make it easier for traditional firms to develop services that meets the needs of most SMEs. Many banks make due with an enhanced retail bank offering or a \\u2018lite\\u2019 version of their corporate offerings\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aboth versions tend to fall short of meeting SME needs. Legacy systems inside banks can also make it difficult to shift customer accounts from one product set to another if an SME is initially put in the \\u2018retail portfolio\\u2019 at the bank.<\\/p><p>Despite much discussion around open APIs and working with FinTech startups, many banks around the table favoured a more human approach to better meet SME needs. Bringing customers into the bank, even giving some of them a seat on the board, was seen as the main tool to better understand SME needs and break down internal barriers at the bank. \\u201cThey are the boss,\\u201d was one comment.<\\/p><p>SME pain points can be huge. They are working 24\\/7 to keep their business running, but many lack basic accounting skills or are uneasy about chasing unpaid invoices. SMEs are looking for control and simplification, according to the roundtable. SMEs want to be able to make deposits, get invoices paid and not have to deal with complex or confusing financial products.<\\/p><p>Digital did not reign supreme with SME needs either. Many SMEs are looking for access to human-led customer service where they could pick up the phone and speak to an expert at any time. \\u201cWhen you are dealing with amounts over six figures, people want a personal chat, not 100% digital\\u201d, was one roundtable comment.<\\/p><p>Globally, the majority of businesses can be classified as small businesses.

The only interruption to the discussion came when two enormous anti-terrorist transformer helicopters buzzed the Rainmaking Loft!<\\/p><p>The main findings from the roundtable were as follows:<\\/p><p>Innovation leaders at corporations need to operate with one leg inside an organisation and one leg outside. Being outside a firm allows the leaders to learn and discover new technologies and new business models that can transform the enterprise. While keeping a foot inside a company, keeps lines of communication and collaboration open with senior people at the firm.<\\/p><p>This line of talk moved onto a debate on whether innovation departments need to be centralised, and separate from the main organisation, with their own staff, budget and authority or decentralised. The centralised model had the advantages of a separate budget line which would allow projects to develop without relying on the P&L of separate business units. The decentralised approach emphasised the importance of encouraging the entire firm to engage in innovation projects and activities.<\\/p><p>Innovation tends to signal change for most companies and change is scary.

It was the so-called \\u2018middle layer\\u2019 that was most in need of empowerment when it came to innovation. Many argued that this \\u2018middle layer\\u2019 was not incentivised to try anything new or to embark on innovation projects that have the possibility of failure embedded in its DNA.<\\/p><p>Innovation projects are hard to measure, and including metrics at all might be detrimental to its successes. However, most large corporates operate in a risk culture that requires performance metrics and measurement. The \\u2018can\\u2019t live with metrics\\/can\\u2019t live without metrics\\u2019 debate continues.<\\/p><p>Finally, the roundtable debate focused engaging with and working with startups. The large corporate around the table all expressed an interest and a desire to work with startups\\u200a&mdash;\\u200agiven that the search for new technologies and solutions is often found in the startup community.<\\/p><p>Their advice for any startup looking to sell into or partner with a larger organisation was to make sure that they presented their value proposition in a way that made sense for the corporate and their clients\\u2019 needs. If that value proposition was met correctly, a partnership between a corporate and a startup would be more likely to be successful. These successful projects could then be used as evidence to the rest of the company that embarking on an innovation culture was beneficial and worthwhile.<\\/p><p><em>Please join us, or invite a colleague, for our next Rainmaking Session on June 16th\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aWhat\\u2019s the matter with payments?<\\/em><\\/p><p><em><\\/em><em>You will hear from:<\\/em><\\/p><p><em><\\/em>\\u00b7 <em>Jon Prideaux, CEO at Boku<\\/em><\\/p><p><em><\\/em>\\u00b7 <em>Richard Jackson, UK Managing Director, WoraPay<\\/em><\\/p><p><em><\\/em><em><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\\/e\\/the-rainmaking-sessions-whats-the-matter-with-payments-tickets-25602215917\\\">Learn more here<\\/a><\\/em><\\/p>\"}}', '2016-10-31 13:31:30', '2016-10-31 13:31:30', '0c88c3cd-a7d9-4a3d-be87-5f02bddb3c57'),

A real-life person, with wants and desires, flaws and problems\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aand then create a banking relationship for that \\u2018person\\u2019.

He decided to conduct an experiment. He sat down with his family to try and construct a central view of all of their household finances, both incoming and outgoing. All the paycheques, credit cards, pension plans, investments, mortgages, loans etc&hellip;for everyone. And he couldn\\u2019t do it. The struggles his own household were having was reflected in most banks inability to produce a comprehensive, centralised view of their customers.<\\/p><p><span><\\/span>I have spent the past few years writing about the challenges banks face when looking to connect better with their customers. I have hammered home the idea that there is only one channel\\u200a&mdash;\\u200athe customer channel. But I have never looked at myself, to illustrate this, with a personal story.<\\/p><h2>Missed&nbsp;connections<\\/h2><p>My family is a strange beast. Our relationship with providers of financial services is almost, exclusively centred on one bank. We have our joint account, our mortgage, our credit cards, ISAs, pensions, savings accounts\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aall with the same institution. That should mean if any bank has a clear, helicopter view of my family\\u2019s financial situation\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aor even recognize who I am\\u200a&mdash;\\u200ait should be my bank.<\\/p><p><span><\\/span>You\\u2019d think.<\\/p><p>Recently, we decided to redo our mortgage to get a better rate\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aon the advice of our relationship manager. (We\\u2019ll call him \\u2018Alan\\u2019 for the sake of this story). When we sent in the forms, the bank came back to my husband to say \\u2018Wait, your wife (who is named on your joint account) doesn\\u2019t live at the address where we were doing the remortgage.\\u2019<\\/p><p>What, wait, what?<\\/p><p>Let\\u2019s back up a bit.<\\/p><p>My family\\u200a&mdash;\\u200awhich is myself, my husband and our son (and at the time a hamster\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aRIP \\u2018Kevin\\u2019) \\u2013moved to a new house in 2013. It\\u2019s a lovely house, with a double layer garden, big kitchen, on a dead end street, detached\\u200a&mdash;\\u200abut those aren\\u2019t the details you, the reader, should be concerned with now.<\\/p><p>Anyone who has moved house knows the joys of \\u2018changing your addresses at every credit card, loyalty points scheme, electoral register etc&hellip;One of the first addresses we changed was on our joint account. Actually, the first address we changed, was on our mortgage papers, which has both my husband\\u2019s and my name on it. Then we changed our joint account. Which is where our standing order for our mortgage is paid out from.<\\/p><p>We had two blissful years of living in our lovely, London suburbs house, paying our mortgage out of our joint account. Paper documents, listing these accounts, were posted to our domestic idyll.<\\/p><p>Then we tried to remortgage. We found out, that according to our bank\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aI still lived at the little Victoria terraced house, on a street in southeast London\\u200a&mdash;\\u200awhere we have lived two years prior.<\\/p><p>Mind you\\u200a&mdash;\\u200amy credit card travelled to the new house (it has five bedrooms and a grannie flat\\u200a&mdash;\\u200ayou really must drop by when you are in town) My savings account, travelled to the new house. My Sainsbury\\u2019s Nectar points card\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aswitched address. But only my husband\\u2019s side of the *joint-account* travelled a few miles, to the outskirts of London, to the Kent borders.<\\/p><p>Why? Because it was only my husband, who changed the address.<\\/p><p>To quote our relationship manager\\u200a&mdash;\\u200a\\u201cWe do not *assume* that that both names on a joint account live at the same&nbsp;address.\\u201d<\\/p><p>:-|<\\/p><p>Please do not argue with me about bank procedure and KYC and regulations\\u200a&mdash;\\u200alike you work at a bank.

Right there. Ground zero. The Lumley Household. Kent, UK.<\\/p><p><span><\\/span>The problem lies not in banks refusing to fix the customer experience problem.

Debates around systematic basis within financial services and tech, the glass ceiling and whether or not women know how to adequately \\u2018lean in\\u2019 (or whether they even need to) are starting to grate on my last nerve.<\\/p><p>So, in an effort to cultivate this attitude of focusing in the positive, I am going to throw out a brand new, entirely unscientific theory about why there needs to be more women in the FinTech space and why your company needs to hire more women now.<\\/p><h2>Why You Need To Hire More Women- Now<\\/h2><p>Women are more fun.<\\/p><p><span><\\/span>There, I said it. Women make work more pleasant. They laugh, they are supportive. I don\\u2019t know many women who would sit and lecture for an hour on the PSD, in a stuffy room, in a grey suit. But I know many who would chat about the ramifications of the PSD 2, while wearing statement jewellery and sipping a glass of wine.

The FemTech meetups were born out of a Swift Innotribe project for Sibos last year, and enabled by Sam Maule of Carlisle Consulting, to showcase and promote the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.femtechleaders.com\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">various women who work in global financial technology.<\\/a><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.femtechleaders.com\\/\\\"><\\/a>The numbers are appalling. <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.cityam.com\\/236156\\/women-in-fintech-four-ways-to-close-the-gender-gap-\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Less than five percent of startup founders<\\/a> in the FinTech space are women.

As with any large transformational project, success or failure tend to depend on the right mix of culture and human relationships.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This was the main crux of the discussion at the inaugural Rainmaking Session\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aHow to foster a corporate innovation culture\\u200a&mdash;\\u200ahosted by Rainmaking Innovation in May.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A wide range of corporate innovation leaders and learners from organisations as diverse as Standard & Poors, BP and SwissRe gathered to hear a discussion led by Rachael Jackson, Solutions, Design, Services at RBS and Alex Farcet, partner at Rainmaking Innovation.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The conversation around the table, conducted under the Chatham House Rule, came thick and fast as participants&nbsp;relayed stories of their own companies\\u2019 internal challenges, strategies and successes. The only interruption to the discussion came when two enormous anti-terrorist transformer helicopters buzzed over&nbsp;the Rainmaking Loft!<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/Picture1_161031_172030.png#asset:309\\\"><br><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Our Findings<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The main findings from the roundtable were as follows:<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation leaders at corporations need to operate with one leg inside an organisation and one leg outside. Being outside a firm allows the leaders to learn and discover new technologies and new business models that can transform the enterprise. While keeping a foot inside a company, keeps lines of communication and collaboration open with senior people at the firm.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This line of talk moved onto a debate on whether innovation departments need to be centralised, and separate from the main organisation, with their own staff, budget and authority, or decentralised. The centralised model had the advantages of a separate budget line which would allow projects to develop without relying on the P&L of separate business units. The decentralised approach emphasised the importance of encouraging the entire firm to engage in innovation projects and activities.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation tends to signal change for most companies and change is scary. People and culture are key to ensuring that establishing an&nbsp;innovation culture is seen as beneficial and empowering to the rest of the organisation.<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/1KuyS3TbSOtuUIL3loV17JA.png#asset:140:url\\\" alt=\\\"1KuyS3TbSOtuUIL3loV17JA.png#asset:140\\\"><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many around the Rainmaking Session breakfast table recognised that a large number of&nbsp;innovation projects were led by either senior management or staff working hands on in development. It was the so-called \\u2018middle layer\\u2019 that was most in need of empowerment when it came to innovation. A large proportion of the group argued that this \\u2018middle layer\\u2019 was not incentivised to try anything new or to embark on innovation projects that have the possibility of failure embedded in their DNA.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation projects are hard to measure, and including metrics at all might be detrimental to its successes. However, most large corporates operate in a risk culture that requires performance metrics and measurement. The \\u2018can\\u2019t live with metrics\\/can\\u2019t live without metrics\\u2019 debate continues.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Advice to Startups<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Finally, the roundtable debate focused engaging with and working with startups. The large corporate around the table all expressed an interest and a desire to work with startups\\u200a&mdash;\\u200agiven that the search for new technologies and solutions is often found in the startup community.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Their advice for any startup looking to sell into or partner with a larger organisation was to make sure that they presented their value proposition in a way that made sense for the corporate and their clients\\u2019 needs. If that value proposition was met correctly, a partnership between a corporate and a startup would be more likely to be successful. These successful projects could then be used as evidence to the rest of the company that embarking on an innovation culture was beneficial and worthwhile.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Please join us, or invite a colleague, for our next Rainmaking Session on June 16th\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aWhat\\u2019s the matter with payments?<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>You will hear from:<\\/em>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul><li><em>Jon Prideaux, CEO at Boku<\\/em><\\/li><li><em>Richard Jackson, UK Managing Director, WoraPay<\\/em><\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\\/e\\/the-rainmaking-sessions-whats-the-matter-with-payments-tickets-25602215917\\\">Learn more here<\\/a><\\/em><\\/p>\"}}', '2016-10-31 18:03:09', '2016-10-31 18:03:09', '69797729-57eb-4a5b-b58c-ceddfd902df4'),

Now, if you were sitting in your car waiting in traffic this morning, you might be thinking, \\u201cyeah, right\\u201d. Though if your car is not the only way you travel, you might have experienced the changes for yourself. In European cities such as Berlin, alternative urban mobility services such as car sharing have&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/files.lsecities.net\\/files\\/2015\\/09\\/New-Urban-Mobility-London-and-Berlin.pdf\\\">decreased the dominance<\\/a>&nbsp;of car ownership as the main method of urban transportation.&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Car2go, Uber and apps like ally are just three examples of such services that are changing the way we get from A to B. That is not to say that car ownership is no longer significant. Indeed&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/files.lsecities.net\\/files\\/2015\\/09\\/New-Urban-Mobility-London-and-Berlin.pdf\\\">73% of households<\\/a>&nbsp;in Berlin still own at least one car. Needless to say, if the shift from car ownership to mobility services is inevitable, we still have a long way to go. There are, however, trends that are spurring on this shift. We\\u2019ll take a closer look at three of them: smartphone adoption, urbanization, and \\u201caccess over ownership\\u201d.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>Smartphone Adoption<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In Germany, the use of mobile devices to access the internet on the go is on the rise. According to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.emarketer.com\\/Article\\/Germany-Posts-Big-Increase-Mobile-Internet-Use\\/1011884#sthash.vNbOGCYz.dpuf\\\">data&nbsp;from emarketer<\\/a>, in 2015 54% of residents used their smartphone to access the Internet in comparison to 40% in 2013. In addition,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/files.lsecities.net\\/files\\/2015\\/09\\/New-Urban-Mobility-London-and-Berlin.pdf\\\">28% of Berlin residents<\\/a>&nbsp;use travel apps with their smartphones daily, while another 22% use travel apps one to three times a week. The further adoption of smartphones will likely lead to an increase in the use of new mobility services and provide an opportunity for businesses and other stakeholders to use this platform to create new technology.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>Urbanization<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Urbanization is a global megatrend.&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.cia.gov\\/library\\/publications\\/the-world-factbook\\/geos\\/gm.html\\\">Over 75% of the population<\\/a>&nbsp;of Germany lives in cities and it is estimated that by 2030,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.cinum.org\\/en\\/urbanisation-mobility\\/88-90-114.html\\\">60% of the world\\u2019s population<\\/a>&nbsp;will live in cities. Combine this with the trend that people are spending more time in transit, and it becomes clear that municipal governments have a major challenge on their hands.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Their job will be to improve quality of life in denser cities. Due to this charging urban environment, car ownership will become increasingly difficult to support.

They get very excited, they also feel a lot of pressure to do something and then they randomly do things.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the trends that we see, is organizations recognizing that working with startups is one channel but building products startup style is another, so the trend is really focusing on closing that loop. That\'s one of the things we see, the other one is really diversification. So, looking at innovation, not a box ticking exercise, but it\'s something that has to have many different iterations and many different facets.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>On the positive side, we see organizations trying a variety of different things; setting up their own investment funds, working with accelerators, doing their own incubation initiatives, having very structured programs for themselves. But also, putting a lot of effort into internal innovation initiatives by educating people about change, by giving them the opportunity to see other ways of working by giving them the opportunity to collaborate with competitors.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The smart organizations recognize that they need to do multiple things at the same time and they need to allow themselves to fail. They also need to connect the internal and external innovation efforts. If you just take startup engagement for instance; startups come in different stages and they have different needs and also different benefits for the organization. So, you can be part of an accelerator to see very early stage startups, to get excited by the the spirit and the drive and the passion of entrepreneurs, but also just to see the very latest trends.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When it comes to using real technology that has been built by startups then you have to look at something that is maybe a little bit more advanced, maybe a little bit more mature, but that engagement has to be different. Maybe it\'s more like a managed lab, maybe it\'s trying to find ways of incorporating the technology into the business. And this is something that often happens by exploring. By using something like a startup studio, something like a separate entity, separate organization, that is bringing people together with startup experience and putting them together with project people from the organization who know about the business.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The interesting thing in this new and evolving landscape is that organizations still sometimes cling on to the idea of \\u201cwe have to do everything ourselves,\\u201d and the smarter organizations recognize that there\'s certain things that you cannot do as a bank, as an insurer, as a large corporate by yourself. Because you don\'t have the know how, you don\'t have the expertise; but also, when It comes to collaboration, which is really important in this space, you usually cannot easily collaborate, by yourself, with other parties. So, having a neutral organization, having somebody like a startupbootcamp who would come in the middle, who brings people around the table and gets them to openly share their challenges, share their problems and priorities, and get them to jointly engage with startups is something that we\'ve seen being very successful.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-11-10 10:59:35', '2016-11-10 10:59:35', '96304385-3df8-4ffa-bfa7-3d8a18ac518a'),

Major corporates are tuning their inhouse hierarchy to fit in \\u201cinnovation\\u201d in their culture, vision and value. To an extent that nowadays, there is a specific job title in major healthcare conglomerates called, \\u201cChief Innovation Officer\\u201d to build innovation cultures in the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So what exactly is an Innovation culture, and why is it suddenly a necessity? Let us explore this and its role specifically in the field of healthcare.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation Culture is a company environment chosen by the leaders to encourage and facilitate unorthodox ideas and strategies. In these companies, innovation is not just a privilege of the C-level, but employee at any level is encouraged to foster the culture and be innovative in their approach.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>So why is it suddenly a necessity?<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many companies working the traditional way for decades now suddenly are shifting towards innovation cultures. There are several factors contributing to this shift.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The primary reason for this shift is Digitalization. Digitalization has paced up the market, the customer has a strong voice and bad performance instantly gets bad reviews. Hence, the scope of error has reduced hugely, making it paramount for companies to invent new ways of customer satisfaction.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The second factor weighing in is the rise of startups. Startups are agile and flexible, they are not afraid to be different and to try a road not taken, because they have nothing to lose. Large corporates, on the other hand, have much to lose if they try something that is not a standard norm.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The third and the most crucial factor is the consumer market. Consumers have changed, trust is still valuable but so is creativity. Market models have changed and even the old and established market structures are undergoing a change. This makes innovation paramount.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>But what does innovation culture comprise of?<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation Culture is not a pet project, it is a style of thinking. It is not a creative inborn talent, it is a practiced skill. Which also means that there is not set way or rules to this culture, but every team builds its own culture. Here are some factors we see overlapping in all companies fostering Innovation Culture.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>1.&nbsp;Speed<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The need of innovation arises from fast &nbsp;changing market needs, hence shorter innovation cycles are paramount. Speculation over long time leads to slowness, the very evil corporations are trying to avoid. However, speed needs to come from quick decision making and clarity in vision, and not rash decisions.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Digitalization<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Digitalization is one of the primary reasons behind the shift in markets. So it is imperative for corporates to not just add but make digitalization an integral part of their outreach plan. The consumer expects companies to fill gaps and be more service oriented, and digitalization is the fastest way to address this need.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>3. Open leadership<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While it is important for the company founders and leaders to value and encourage innovation cultures, in successful innovation culture implementation, lower management also believes and practices an open creative culture, as these are the people who function directly with execution and micro manage teams.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Value in failure<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One reason why corporations fail at innovation is because they are risk averse. They are big and protecting the name becomes more and more important. But as one adopts innovation culture, one needs to learn the art of accepting failure. An interesting take is to call a Failure a \\u201cglitch\\u201d. While a failure sounds painfully permanent, a glitch sounds temporary, solvable and a learning opportunity.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Sustaining innovation<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is a tough task to get your employees to embrace innovation culture, but it is equally important to get them to stay on course. It can not be just a one-project affair. To get employees to show innovativity in workplace, there can be rewards, from as big as a holiday to as tiny as sincere appreciation.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>6.&nbsp;Flat hierarchy<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Flat hierarchy is a fast-evolving management style that many companies are adopting. Some people call it Bossless Management, some call it Radical Management and some, Holacracy, but the core of the concept remains the same. The concept does away with leadership\\u2019s sole decision making power and gives the power to the collective intelligence of all employees. One good example of Holacracy is&nbsp;###a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/searchcio.techtarget.com\\/feature\\/Flap-over-Zappos-holacracy-puts-spotlight-on-bossless-workplace\\\"&gt;Zappos, one of the largest companies to have adopted bossless administration.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>All innovative companies have different missions, but their processes are similar. They encourage unorthodox methods that include speed, flexibility, adaptation of digital technology, flat hierarchies and sustainable innovation.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-11-15 17:20:50', '2016-11-15 17:20:50', 'f037244a-4930-4d2d-9cb8-9f00efd7a82b'),

Are you the 800 pound gorilla?<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;We talked about this a lot when I first joined DCG \\u2013 Why do we come to work in the morning? What inspires us? What motivates us?<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I think all of us fundamentally see bitcoin blockchain technology changing the financial system and the broader technology landscape.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It doesn\\u2019t matter if we\\u2019re the 800 pound gorilla or the small upstart. I think for us we want to have an outsize impact and be an advocate, an evangelist, and the connector that helps make this industry more successful.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see accelerators as a good idea for bitcoin and blockchain startups?<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, absolutely.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One thing I have noticed is that people who have gone through an accelerator program were much better at pitching, were much better at selling the value proposition, and were much better at creating a narrative. That skill set cannot be underestimated. You\\u2019re going through this rigorous program that\\u2019s designed to teach you all of these fantastic skills and competencies, and you\\u2019re learning from some of the best corporate VCs, the best corporate strategists, the best VCs, the best startup mentors that you normally wouldn\\u2019t have access to in your network. It\\u2019s a great way to compress that learning in a really short timeline and to really grow your network and also get great PR. No brainer for me.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Obviously, we\\u2019re super excited to have Startupbootcamp FinTech here and really excited about the startups that will go through your program.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse: &nbsp;What\\u2019s your general advice for startups who might be applying for an accelerator?<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;I think people are always a little hesitant about applying. They think: \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s three months away from product development. That\\u2019s difficult. I want to focus on the tech.\\u201d No, no, no, no! Spend three months really getting good at sales, at communicating, at branding, at messaging, building relationships. That is going to do so much more for you&nbsp;than building a great product because growth takes two things. It takes a great product, but it also takes a great sales strategy. Remember that there\\u2019s more to the equation than just the technology and really focus on this opportunity to develop relationships and competencies that are going to help you grow beyond the seed stage.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you see the venture capital model heading in five years?<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;I think a lot more people are excited about venture capital. A lot of people want to be investors. It\\u2019s like a sexy thing to do right now, which is great. I love it. The more money that goes into the ecosystem, the more ideas start getting thrown around.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What I think you\\u2019re seeing, though, is a decoupling of the size of the check that an investor\\u2019s able to write and the value that they\\u2019re able to add to an early stage company. We at DCG invest at the seed stage. We aim for 2% to 5% ownership, but we write smaller cheques.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What you\\u2019re going to start to see are two different types of investors. You\\u2019re going to see one investor who\\u2019s really focused on network effects, on connectivity, who\\u2019s really focused on value-added services, and another investor that\\u2019s really focused on late stage growth. They\\u2019re going to play two very different roles within the life cycle of a startup.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;What advice would you have for companies who want to pitch DCG?<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp; For us, we\\u2019re seed stage investors. What our investing team looks at are three things. Number one, the team. Who are you? What\\u2019s your track record and what\\u2019s your story? Why are you starting this company? We need to see that you have grit and that you have determination and that you really care.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The second is product. Technically, what have you built? Open source software is notoriously competitive, so having teams that are technically competent is very important.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Then the last one is market. How do you think about monetization, and what\\u2019s the timeline on that? We\\u2019re different from most VCs in that we\\u2019re not a fund. We don\\u2019t have a certain timeline. If it\\u2019s going to take you 10 years to reach profitability, I think we\\u2019re okay with that, but you need to have a plan and then you need to have a backup plan and a backup plan to the backup plan.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jesse:&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the role of Community Manager, how do you see it evolving?<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Meltem:&nbsp;&nbsp;When I started my role was pretty specific. It was focused on developing better connective tissue between our companies. Now that we have a number of strategic investors on board we started to realize the value of having a broad network. For me, it\\u2019s about building the DCG brand, building relationships, and also creating new opportunities and new ways of thinking around how to internalize innovation within a large organization. &nbsp;It\\u2019s about taking the community role, untangling into the various components that really move the needle and making it more of a discipline.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To read the full interview, please click<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.linkedin.com\\/pulse\\/my-interview-meltem-demirors-dcg-jesse-podell?published=t\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">&nbsp;here<\\/a>:<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Follow&nbsp;Meltem Demirors on <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/Melt_Dem\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Twitter<\\/a><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/twitter.com\\/Melt_Dem\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"><\\/a>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;\\u2013<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/dcg.co\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Digital Currency Group&nbsp;<\\/a>manages a large early stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain space.

Insurers without a plan for some form of chatbot pilot risk losing out as online advertising undergoes its next big step change.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Chatbots are the hottest customer-centric innovative technology of 2016 so far. In March,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2016\\/3\\/30\\/11332494\\/microsoft-bot-framework-build\\\">Microsoft<\\/a>&nbsp;announced the launch of a new platform that will enable anyone to build one. In April,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/04\\/12\\/agents-on-messenger\\/\\\">Facebook<\\/a>&nbsp;announced the launch of chatbots on its existing Messenger platform.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What are chatbots? At the most basic level, these are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate conversations with a real person.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>They have the obvious potential benefit of replacing customer service staff \\u2013 or freeing up those employees for other tasks, thus increasing productivity. But the marketing potential is even greater, as they enable companies to initiate conversations with customers online based on what sites they\\u2019re on and what kind of services they might be looking for.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Targeting new customers more effectively<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In insurance, they could be used to replace the need to fill out long, tedious forms. Not only that, but since a chatbot can initiate a conversation, you can use them to proactively target prospective customers rather than wait for them to come to you. This is the vision behind Spixii, a startup we\\u2019ve been working with at InsurTech.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Spixii aims to make the buying of health and travel insurance more intuitive and fun for millennials, and to generate more revenues for insurers by opening up the relatively untapped millennial market \\u2013 and then upselling to these consumers in a more targeted and less pushy manner.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With Spixii, the chatbot acts you\\u2019re having an online conversation with a human insurance agent, asking you questions and responding to your answers. The consumer gets a more engaging experience than just filling out a form, while the insurer can carry out an accurate risk assessment.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Right now Spixii has several tier one insurers interested in partnering with them to run a pilot. They also have just been accepted on the Allianz Accelerator programme in France to test their offering further. Cynics may dismiss the technology as a gimmick. But no one can afford not to start experimenting with it, for one very simple reason: Facebook wants to supplant Google as the number one advertising platform on the internet, and they\\u2019re investing heavily in chatbots to help them do this.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Facebook is no longer a social media company \\u2013 here\\u2019s why that matters<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.vox.com\\/2016\\/5\\/10\\/11640140\\/facebook-media-influence\\\">Facebook<\\/a>&nbsp;is no longer a social network. It\\u2019s a technology holding company just like Google, and it now comprises social media, photo-sharing (Instagram), messaging (WhatsApp) and virtual reality (Oculus). It\\u2019s also the largest media distributor in history.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The company has grown with one goal: to make it so that no one who uses the internet ever has to leave the Facebook platform. Once we reach \\u201cPeak Facebook\\u201d \\u2013 the point at which the majority of the world\\u2019s internet users spend all their internet time on one or other of Facebook\\u2019s apps \\u2013 it will become pointless to advertise anywhere else.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After all, Facebook already tales up 22% of the internet time that Americans spend on mobile devices, compared with 11% on Google search and YouTube combined. And Facebook\'s advertising revenues have more than doubled in the last two years, to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.economist.com\\/news\\/briefing\\/21696507-social-network-has-turned-itself-one-worlds-most-influential-technology-giants\\\">$18 billion in 2015<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Chatbot failure is not an option<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And why is Facebook so interested in chatbots? Because by creating its own advertising platform, it can control how people buy products and services online. Specifically, the company wants the whole transaction to take place within its own platform \\u2013 so customers never have to leave it. And hosting chatbots looks set to be one of the most effective ways of doing this.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now, this trend towards internet dominance may or may not pay off. And it certainly throws up some questions about the fact that Facebook could end up with complete control \\u2013 or at least de facto dominance \\u2013 over how companies can advertise to their consumers online. But Facebook\\u2019s growth has been so phenomenal, and its increasing influence so unstoppable, that running some kind of chatbot pilot is not something insurers can afford to see as a luxury. It\\u2019s a necessity.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>How insurers can exploit this trend<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The fastest way to trial your own chatbot is through partnerships and pilots \\u2013 either with technology companies themselves or with innovative startups who aim to solve a business problem that you\\u2019re struggling with.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To go back to the example of Spixii I mentioned before: this company represents an ideal opportunity for insurers to tap into the millennial market, and, in so doing, to investigate how the technology could be extended to reach other markets and develop attractive new propositions and products. Plus, it potentially offers a level of customer engagement and insight for small premium insurance products that just wouldn\\u2019t be affordable otherwise.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Facebook is serious about this technology. If successful, it could transform the world of online advertising beyond recognition. It may be that insurers can\\u2019t afford not to trial the technology, but those who are successful stand to reap huge potential rewards.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-11-15 17:32:27', '2016-11-15 17:32:27', 'f7863887-1d39-4fca-9666-85a2fa1f4df7'),

There are many footprints in the sandbox, but many may have to wait some time for impressive castles to be built.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The FCA\\u2019s Regulatory Sandbox is meant to be a legal framework or a \\u2018safe space\\u2019 where businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms. This is a progressive step for startups in regulated industries, like financial services. However, many young companies still need active partnerships with established banks, firms and other corporates in order to test developing products with live data, enterprise architecture and an active customer base.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sandboxes, like the one set up by the FCA in the UK, are a step in the right direction for regulated industries. But they struggle to be useful if certain startups aren\\u2019t given the resources to test their products, properly.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The FCA sandbox was designed to allow for collaboration. Currently, there are many FinTech startups involved in the programme. The FCA does not make public the names or the number of startups participating in the sandbox. However, many of these companies still require participation from incumbent banks in order to adequately test their offerings in the safe legal framework the FCA has established.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>However many banks, themselves, are working on creating their own innovation labs to not only support and welcome new technology and services entrants, but to enable and empower their own internal staff to embrace innovation. Many in this industry know that incumbent banks and financial services firms move at a pace considered much slower than is enjoyed in the Silicon Valley-style startup world. This is true even for banks that are working towards creating a more agile and flexible work environment.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The window of opportunity is open now to work within the FCA Regulatory Sandbox.

As the group munched on bacon rolls and sipped tea and coffee, all were in the room with the understanding that small to medium sized businesses are a group that is under loved, underserved and ripe with opportunity.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The roundtable discussion, led by Justin Hannemann, Head of Product Experience (Customer and Innovation), Santander UK and Johanna Pugh, global head of Lending, Misys caused several themes to emerge from the table.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>SMEs are quite diverse and can range from everything from a tech-savvy FinTech startup in London to a cat grooming store in Sheffield, for example. This makes SMEs hard to classify and are seen as risky and complex by banks. Categorisation is hard when <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/blog.thecompanywarehouse.co.uk\\/2012\\/07\\/31\\/what-is-an-sme\\/\\\">definitions differ<\\/a> between UK government departments, HMRC and even the EU. As banks enhance their services to retail customers and larger commercial organisations, SMEs get pushed to the bottom.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Internal bank politics as well as legacy systems don\\u2019t make it easier for traditional firms to develop services that meets the needs of most SMEs. Many banks make due with an enhanced retail bank offering or a \\u2018lite\\u2019 version of their corporate offerings\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aboth versions tend to fall short of meeting SME needs. Legacy systems inside banks can also make it difficult to shift customer accounts from one product set to another if an SME is initially put in the \\u2018retail portfolio\\u2019 at the bank.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Despite much discussion around open APIs and working with FinTech startups, many banks around the table favoured a more human approach to better meet SME needs. Bringing customers into the bank, even giving some of them a seat on the board, was seen as the main tool to better understand SME needs and break down internal barriers at the bank. \\u201cThey are the boss,\\u201d was one comment.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>SME pain points can be huge. They are working 24\\/7 to keep their business running, but many lack basic accounting skills or are uneasy about chasing unpaid invoices. SMEs are looking for control and simplification, according to the roundtable. SMEs want to be able to make deposits, get invoices paid and not have to deal with complex or confusing financial products.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Digital did not reign supreme with SME needs either. Many SMEs are looking for access to human-led customer service where they could pick up the phone and speak to an expert at any time. \\u201cWhen you are dealing with amounts over six figures, people want a personal chat, not 100% digital\\u201d, was one roundtable comment.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Globally, the majority of businesses can be classified as small businesses.

The room was full of design people, FinTech folks and bankers. My group were the bankers.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We were assigned to create a person. A real-life person, with wants and desires, flaws and problems\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aand then create a banking relationship for that \\u2018person\\u2019. I was amazed by the variety of different people created by each group.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A group of designers created an old age pensioner, who lived in a rural community and was a widower. Some consultants outlined a single mother of two, who lived in the Northeast in the UK, and was going back to school to continue her education. Yet another group constructed a former addict in London, who had served in Iraq.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>My group, the bankers?

He decided to conduct an experiment. He sat down with his family to try and construct a central view of all of their household finances, both incoming and outgoing. All the paycheques, credit cards, pension plans, investments, mortgages, loans etc&hellip;for everyone. And he couldn\\u2019t do it. The struggles his own household were having was reflected in most banks inability to produce a comprehensive, centralised view of their customers.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I have spent the past few years writing about the challenges banks face when looking to connect better with their customers. I have hammered home the idea that there is only one channel\\u200a&mdash;\\u200athe customer channel. But I have never looked at myself, to illustrate this, with a personal story.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Missed&nbsp;connections<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>My family is a strange beast. Our relationship with providers of financial services is almost, exclusively centred on one bank. We have our joint account, our mortgage, our credit cards, ISAs, pensions, savings accounts\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aall with the same institution. That should mean if any bank has a clear, helicopter view of my family\\u2019s financial situation\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aor even recognize who I am\\u200a&mdash;\\u200ait should be my bank.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You\\u2019d think.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Recently, we decided to redo our mortgage to get a better rate\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aon the advice of our relationship manager. (We\\u2019ll call him \\u2018Alan\\u2019 for the sake of this story). When we sent in the forms, the bank came back to my husband to say \\u2018Wait, your wife (who is named on your joint account) doesn\\u2019t live at the address where we were doing the remortgage.\\u2019<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What, wait, what?<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let\\u2019s back up a bit.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>My family\\u200a&mdash;\\u200awhich is myself, my husband and our son (and at the time a hamster\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aRIP \\u2018Kevin\\u2019) \\u2013moved to a new house in 2013. It\\u2019s a lovely house, with a double layer garden, big kitchen, on a dead end street, detached\\u200a&mdash;\\u200abut those aren\\u2019t the details you, the reader, should be concerned with now.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Anyone who has moved house knows the joys of \\u2018changing your addresses at every credit card, loyalty points scheme, electoral register etc&hellip;One of the first addresses we changed was on our joint account. Actually, the first address we changed, was on our mortgage papers, which has both my husband\\u2019s and my name on it. Then we changed our joint account. Which is where our standing order for our mortgage is paid out from.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We had two blissful years of living in our lovely, London suburbs house, paying our mortgage out of our joint account. Paper documents, listing these accounts, were posted to our domestic idyll.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Then we tried to remortgage. We found out, that according to our bank\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aI still lived at the little Victoria terraced house, on a street in southeast London\\u200a&mdash;\\u200awhere we have lived two years prior.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mind you\\u200a&mdash;\\u200amy credit card travelled to the new house (it has five bedrooms and a grannie flat\\u200a&mdash;\\u200ayou really must drop by when you are in town) My savings account, travelled to the new house. My Sainsbury\\u2019s Nectar points card\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aswitched address. But only my husband\\u2019s side of the *joint-account* travelled a few miles, to the outskirts of London, to the Kent borders.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Why? Because it was only my husband, who changed the address.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To quote our relationship manager\\u200a&mdash;\\u200a\\u201cWe do not *assume* that that both names on a joint account live at the same&nbsp;address.\\u201d<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>:-|<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Please do not argue with me about bank procedure and KYC and regulations\\u200a&mdash;\\u200alike you work at a bank. Think, for a second, like a customer.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Two years after moving. Two years after dealing with my bank from the same address. Two years\\u2019 worth of \\u2018customer transaction data\\u2019 (yes, I know <em>banks<\\/em> can\\u2019t really use that!) Two years after *signing* the mortgage papers in a branch of the bank! 18 years of being a customer of this bank. I had to travel to a branch to produce documentation to prove who I was and where I lived.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>*That* is stupid.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Losing the Customer Experience Battle<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That is why banks are losing the customer experience battle. Right there. Ground zero. The Lumley Household. Kent, UK.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The problem lies not in banks refusing to fix the customer experience problem. It lies in the current structure of regulations, legacy infrastructure and culture at banks that make it almost impossible to change the desire to be \\u2018customer-centric\\u2019 into an actual working practice.All of the products that my family holds with our bank\\u200a&mdash;\\u200afrom the current accounts, credit cards, mortgage etc..\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aall of those products are held in separate, distinct databases. Universal banks do not emerge fully formed from the head of the banking gods. They are constructed over time, through waves of acquisitions, and infrastructure products focused on product segments. These projects are built by IT teams that are often seconded in from outside firms (like IBM or Accenture) to work for 18 to 24 months at a time (depending on the project) and, more often than not, have very little direct knowledge of the business.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The customer story inside a bank is not held in a book or a central database. It is held in \\u2018little pockets of data\\u2019 spread all around the bank, in various locations, in an assortment of programming languages and platforms and architecture. These \\u2018little pockets of data\\u2019 never interact, are never reconciled, redundancies are never discovered\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aand most importantly\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aopportunities are never explored.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-11-15 17:37:52', '2016-11-15 17:37:52', '84dc5b95-1836-4286-b6cb-2bb2d14120dd'),

As with any large transformational project, success or failure tend to depend on the right mix of culture and human relationships.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This was the main crux of the discussion at the inaugural Rainmaking Session\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aHow to foster a corporate innovation culture\\u200a&mdash;\\u200ahosted by Rainmaking Innovation in May.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A wide range of corporate innovation leaders and learners from organisations as diverse as Standard & Poors, BP and SwissRe gathered to hear a discussion led by Rachael Jackson, Solutions, Design, Services at RBS and Alex Farcet, partner at Rainmaking Innovation.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The conversation around the table, conducted under the Chatham House Rule, came thick and fast as participants&nbsp;relayed stories of their own companies\\u2019 internal challenges, strategies and successes. The only interruption to the discussion came when two enormous anti-terrorist transformer helicopters buzzed over&nbsp;the Rainmaking Loft!<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/Picture1_161031_172030.png#asset:309:url\\\" alt=\\\"Picture1_161031_172030.png#asset:309\\\"><br><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Our Findings<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The main findings from the roundtable were as follows:<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation leaders at corporations need to operate with one leg inside an organisation and one leg outside. Being outside a firm allows the leaders to learn and discover new technologies and new business models that can transform the enterprise. While keeping a foot inside a company, keeps lines of communication and collaboration open with senior people at the firm.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This line of talk moved onto a debate on whether innovation departments need to be centralised, and separate from the main organisation, with their own staff, budget and authority, or decentralised. The centralised model had the advantages of a separate budget line which would allow projects to develop without relying on the P&L of separate business units. The decentralised approach emphasised the importance of encouraging the entire firm to engage in innovation projects and activities.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation tends to signal change for most companies and change is scary. People and culture are key to ensuring that establishing an&nbsp;innovation culture is seen as beneficial and empowering to the rest of the organisation.<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/s3.amazonaws.com\\/rainmaking\\/websiteImages\\/1KuyS3TbSOtuUIL3loV17JA.png#asset:140:url\\\" alt=\\\"1KuyS3TbSOtuUIL3loV17JA.png#asset:140\\\"><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many around the Rainmaking Session breakfast table recognised that a large number of&nbsp;innovation projects were led by either senior management or staff working hands on in development. It was the so-called \\u2018middle layer\\u2019 that was most in need of empowerment when it came to innovation. A large proportion of the group argued that this \\u2018middle layer\\u2019 was not incentivised to try anything new or to embark on innovation projects that have the possibility of failure embedded in their DNA.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation projects are hard to measure, and including metrics at all might be detrimental to its successes. However, most large corporates operate in a risk culture that requires performance metrics and measurement. The \\u2018can\\u2019t live with metrics\\/can\\u2019t live without metrics\\u2019 debate continues.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Advice to Startups<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Finally, the roundtable debate focused engaging with and working with startups. The large corporate around the table all expressed an interest and a desire to work with startups\\u200a&mdash;\\u200agiven that the search for new technologies and solutions is often found in the startup community.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Their advice for any startup looking to sell into or partner with a larger organisation was to make sure that they presented their value proposition in a way that made sense for the corporate and their clients\\u2019 needs. If that value proposition was met correctly, a partnership between a corporate and a startup would be more likely to be successful. These successful projects could then be used as evidence to the rest of the company that embarking on an innovation culture was beneficial and worthwhile.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Please join us, or invite a colleague, for our next Rainmaking Session on June 16th\\u200a&mdash;\\u200aWhat\\u2019s the matter with payments?<\\/em><\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>You will hear from:<\\/em>&nbsp;<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul><li><em>Jon Prideaux, CEO at Boku<\\/em><\\/li><li><em>Richard Jackson, UK Managing Director, WoraPay<\\/em><\\/li><\\/ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em><a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.eventbrite.co.uk\\/e\\/the-rainmaking-sessions-whats-the-matter-with-payments-tickets-25602215917\\\">Learn more here<\\/a><\\/em><\\/p>\"}}', '2016-11-15 17:38:43', '2016-11-15 17:38:43', '7eb269ad-cab8-4d9e-96a3-fe732113db17'),

Major corporates are tuning their inhouse hierarchy to fit in \\u201cinnovation\\u201d in their culture, vision and value. To an extent that nowadays, there is a specific job title in major healthcare conglomerates called, \\u201cChief Innovation Officer\\u201d to build innovation cultures in the company.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So what exactly is an Innovation culture, and why is it suddenly a necessity? Let us explore this and its role specifically in the field of healthcare.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation Culture is a company environment chosen by the leaders to encourage and facilitate unorthodox ideas and strategies. In these companies, innovation is not just a privilege of the C-level, but employee at any level is encouraged to foster the culture and be innovative in their approach.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>So why is it suddenly a necessity?<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many companies working the traditional way for decades now suddenly are shifting towards innovation cultures. There are several factors contributing to this shift.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The primary reason for this shift is Digitalization. Digitalization has paced up the market, the customer has a strong voice and bad performance instantly gets bad reviews. Hence, the scope of error has reduced hugely, making it paramount for companies to invent new ways of customer satisfaction.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The second factor weighing in is the rise of startups. Startups are agile and flexible, they are not afraid to be different and to try a road not taken, because they have nothing to lose. Large corporates, on the other hand, have much to lose if they try something that is not a standard norm.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The third and the most crucial factor is the consumer market. Consumers have changed, trust is still valuable but so is creativity. Market models have changed and even the old and established market structures are undergoing a change. This makes innovation paramount.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h1>But what does innovation culture comprise of?<\\/h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Innovation Culture is not a pet project, it is a style of thinking. It is not a creative inborn talent, it is a practiced skill. Which also means that there is not set way or rules to this culture, but every team builds its own culture. Here are some factors we see overlapping in all companies fostering Innovation Culture.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>1.&nbsp;Speed<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The need of innovation arises from fast &nbsp;changing market needs, hence shorter innovation cycles are paramount. Speculation over long time leads to slowness, the very evil corporations are trying to avoid. However, speed needs to come from quick decision making and clarity in vision, and not rash decisions.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>2.&nbsp;Digitalization<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Digitalization is one of the primary reasons behind the shift in markets. So it is imperative for corporates to not just add but make digitalization an integral part of their outreach plan. The consumer expects companies to fill gaps and be more service oriented, and digitalization is the fastest way to address this need.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>3. Open leadership<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While it is important for the company founders and leaders to value and encourage innovation cultures, in successful innovation culture implementation, lower management also believes and practices an open creative culture, as these are the people who function directly with execution and micro manage teams.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>4.&nbsp;Value in failure<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One reason why corporations fail at innovation is because they are risk averse. They are big and protecting the name becomes more and more important. But as one adopts innovation culture, one needs to learn the art of accepting failure. An interesting take is to call a Failure a \\u201cglitch\\u201d. While a failure sounds painfully permanent, a glitch sounds temporary, solvable and a learning opportunity.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>5.&nbsp;Sustaining innovation<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is a tough task to get your employees to embrace innovation culture, but it is equally important to get them to stay on course. It can not be just a one-project affair. To get employees to show innovativity in workplace, there can be rewards, from as big as a holiday to as tiny as sincere appreciation.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>6.&nbsp;Flat hierarchy<\\/h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Flat hierarchy is a fast-evolving management style that many companies are adopting. Some people call it Bossless Management, some call it Radical Management and some, Holacracy, but the core of the concept remains the same. The concept does away with leadership\\u2019s sole decision making power and gives the power to the collective intelligence of all employees. One good example of Holacracy is&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/searchcio.techtarget.com\\/feature\\/Flap-over-Zappos-holacracy-puts-spotlight-on-bossless-workplace\\\">Zappos<\\/a>, one of the largest companies to have adopted bossless administration.<\\/p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>All innovative companies have different missions, but their processes are similar. They encourage unorthodox methods that include speed, flexibility, adaptation of digital technology, flat hierarchies and sustainable innovation.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-11-16 15:15:08', '2016-11-16 15:15:08', '78e96e9f-9cfd-4dcc-be99-74cf2f44c77b'),

Insurers without a plan for some form of chatbot pilot risk losing out as online advertising undergoes its next big step change.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Chatbots are the hottest customer-centric innovative technology of 2016 so far. In March,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.theverge.com\\/2016\\/3\\/30\\/11332494\\/microsoft-bot-framework-build\\\">Microsoft<\\/a>&nbsp;announced the launch of a new platform that will enable anyone to build one. In April,&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/techcrunch.com\\/2016\\/04\\/12\\/agents-on-messenger\\/\\\">Facebook<\\/a>&nbsp;announced the launch of chatbots on its existing Messenger platform.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>What are chatbots? At the most basic level, these are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate conversations with a real person.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>They have the obvious potential benefit of replacing customer service staff \\u2013 or freeing up those employees for other tasks, thus increasing productivity. But the marketing potential is even greater, as they enable companies to initiate conversations with customers online based on what sites they\\u2019re on and what kind of services they might be looking for.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Targeting new customers more effectively<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>In insurance, they could be used to replace the need to fill out long, tedious forms. Not only that, but since a chatbot can initiate a conversation, you can use them to proactively target prospective customers rather than wait for them to come to you. This is the vision behind Spixii, a startup we\\u2019ve been working with at InsurTech.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Spixii aims to make the buying of health and travel insurance more intuitive and fun for millennials, and to generate more revenues for insurers by opening up the relatively untapped millennial market \\u2013 and then upselling to these consumers in a more targeted and less pushy manner.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>With Spixii, the chatbot acts you\\u2019re having an online conversation with a human insurance agent, asking you questions and responding to your answers. The consumer gets a more engaging experience than just filling out a form, while the insurer can carry out an accurate risk assessment.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Right now Spixii has several tier one insurers interested in partnering with them to run a pilot. They also have just been accepted on the Allianz Accelerator programme in France to test their offering further. Cynics may dismiss the technology as a gimmick. But no one can afford not to start experimenting with it, for one very simple reason: Facebook wants to supplant Google as the number one advertising platform on the internet, and they\\u2019re investing heavily in chatbots to help them do this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Facebook is no longer a social media company \\u2013 here\\u2019s why that matters<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.vox.com\\/2016\\/5\\/10\\/11640140\\/facebook-media-influence\\\">Facebook<\\/a>&nbsp;is no longer a social network. It\\u2019s a technology holding company just like Google, and it now comprises social media, photo-sharing (Instagram), messaging (WhatsApp) and virtual reality (Oculus). It\\u2019s also the largest media distributor in history.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The company has grown with one goal: to make it so that no one who uses the internet ever has to leave the Facebook platform. Once we reach \\u201cPeak Facebook\\u201d \\u2013 the point at which the majority of the world\\u2019s internet users spend all their internet time on one or other of Facebook\\u2019s apps \\u2013 it will become pointless to advertise anywhere else.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>After all, Facebook already tales up 22% of the internet time that Americans spend on mobile devices, compared with 11% on Google search and YouTube combined. And Facebook\'s advertising revenues have more than doubled in the last two years, to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.economist.com\\/news\\/briefing\\/21696507-social-network-has-turned-itself-one-worlds-most-influential-technology-giants\\\">$18 billion in 2015<\\/a>.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Chatbot failure is not an option<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>And why is Facebook so interested in chatbots? Because by creating its own advertising platform, it can control how people buy products and services online. Specifically, the company wants the whole transaction to take place within its own platform \\u2013 so customers never have to leave it. And hosting chatbots looks set to be one of the most effective ways of doing this.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Now, this trend towards internet dominance may or may not pay off. And it certainly throws up some questions about the fact that Facebook could end up with complete control \\u2013 or at least de facto dominance \\u2013 over how companies can advertise to their consumers online. But Facebook\\u2019s growth has been so phenomenal, and its increasing influence so unstoppable, that running some kind of chatbot pilot is not something insurers can afford to see as a luxury. It\\u2019s a necessity.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><strong>How insurers can exploit this trend<\\/strong><\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The fastest way to trial your own chatbot is through partnerships and pilots \\u2013 either with technology companies themselves or with innovative startups who aim to solve a business problem that you\\u2019re struggling with.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>To go back to the example of Spixii I mentioned before: this company represents an ideal opportunity for insurers to tap into the millennial market, and, in so doing, to investigate how the technology could be extended to reach other markets and develop attractive new propositions and products. Plus, it potentially offers a level of customer engagement and insight for small premium insurance products that just wouldn\\u2019t be affordable otherwise.<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Facebook is serious about this technology. If successful, it could transform the world of online advertising beyond recognition. It may be that insurers can\\u2019t afford not to trial the technology, but those who are successful stand to reap huge potential rewards.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-12-06 11:44:56', '2016-12-06 11:44:56', 'dd5bfde3-1aa2-4224-9b0d-69513186f425'),

 ('126', 'field', '15', 'en_us', ' there is only one channel the customer channel a few years ago don callahan head of operations technology at citi gave a talk at the bank s annual digital money symposium in london he decided to conduct an experiment he sat down with his family to try and construct a central view of all of their household finances both incoming and outgoing all the paycheques credit cards pension plans investments mortgages loans etcfor everyone and he couldn t do it the struggles his own household were having was reflected in most banks inability to produce a comprehensive centralised view of their customers i have spent the past few years writing about the challenges banks face when looking to connect better with their customers i have hammered home the idea that there is only one channel the customer channel but i have never looked at myself to illustrate this with a personal story missed connections my family is a strange beast our relationship with providers of financial services is almost exclusively centred on one bank we have our joint account our mortgage our credit cards isas pensions savings accounts all with the same institution that should mean if any bank has a clear helicopter view of my family s financial situation or even recognize who i am it should be my bank you d think recently we decided to redo our mortgage to get a better rate on the advice of our relationship manager we ll call him alan for the sake of this story when we sent in the forms the bank came back to my husband to say wait your wife who is named on your joint account doesn t live at the address where we were doing the remortgage what wait what let s back up a bit my family which is myself my husband and our son and at the time a hamster rip kevin moved to a new house in 2013 it s a lovely house with a double layer garden big kitchen on a dead end street detached but those aren t the details you the reader should be concerned with now anyone who has moved house knows the joys of changing your addresses at every credit card loyalty points scheme electoral register etcone of the first addresses we changed was on our joint account actually the first address we changed was on our mortgage papers which has both my husband s and my name on it then we changed our joint account which is where our standing order for our mortgage is paid out from we had two blissful years of living in our lovely london suburbs house paying our mortgage out of our joint account paper documents listing these accounts were posted to our domestic idyll then we tried to remortgage we found out that according to our bank i still lived at the little victoria terraced house on a street in southeast london where we have lived two years prior mind you my credit card travelled to the new house it has five bedrooms and a grannie flat you really must drop by when you are in town my savings account travelled to the new house my sainsbury s nectar points card switched address but only my husband s side of the joint account travelled a few miles to the outskirts of london to the kent borders why because it was only my husband who changed the address to quote our relationship manager we do not assume that that both names on a joint account live at the same address please do not argue with me about bank procedure and kyc and regulations like you work at a bank think for a second like a customer two years after moving two years after dealing with my bank from the same address two years worth of customer transaction data yes i know banks can t really use that two years after signing the mortgage papers in a branch of the bank 18 years of being a customer of this bank i had to travel to a branch to produce documentation to prove who i was and where i lived that is stupid losing the customer experience battle that is why banks are losing the customer experience battle right there ground zero the lumley household kent uk the problem lies not in banks refusing to fix the customer experience problem it lies in the current structure of regulations legacy infrastructure and culture at banks that make it almost impossible to change the desire to be customer centric into an actual working practice all of the products that my family holds with our bank from the current accounts credit cards mortgage etc all of those products are held in separate distinct databases universal banks do not emerge fully formed from the head of the banking gods they are constructed over time through waves of acquisitions and infrastructure products focused on product segments these projects are built by it teams that are often seconded in from outside firms like ibm or accenture to work for 18 to 24 months at a time depending on the project and more often than not have very little direct knowledge of the business the customer story inside a bank is not held in a book or a central database it is held in little pockets of data spread all around the bank in various locations in an assortment of programming languages and platforms and architecture these little pockets of data never interact are never reconciled redundancies are never discovered and most importantly opportunities are never explored '),

 ('149', 'field', '15', 'en_us', ' chatbots are more than just the latest marketing gimmick they re a clue to how the internet itself is likely to evolve insurers without a plan for some form of chatbot pilot risk losing out as online advertising undergoes its next big step change chatbots are the hottest customer centric innovative technology of 2016 so far in march microsoft announced the launch of a new platform that will enable anyone to build one in april facebook announced the launch of chatbots on its existing messenger platform what are chatbots at the most basic level these are computer programs that use artificial intelligence to simulate conversations with a real person they have the obvious potential benefit of replacing customer service staff or freeing up those employees for other tasks thus increasing productivity but the marketing potential is even greater as they enable companies to initiate conversations with customers online based on what sites they re on and what kind of services they might be looking for targeting new customers more effectively in insurance they could be used to replace the need to fill out long tedious forms not only that but since a chatbot can initiate a conversation you can use them to proactively target prospective customers rather than wait for them to come to you this is the vision behind spixii a startup we ve been working with at insurtech spixii aims to make the buying of health and travel insurance more intuitive and fun for millennials and to generate more revenues for insurers by opening up the relatively untapped millennial market and then upselling to these consumers in a more targeted and less pushy manner with spixii the chatbot acts you re having an online conversation with a human insurance agent asking you questions and responding to your answers the consumer gets a more engaging experience than just filling out a form while the insurer can carry out an accurate risk assessment right now spixii has several tier one insurers interested in partnering with them to run a pilot they also have just been accepted on the allianz accelerator programme in france to test their offering further cynics may dismiss the technology as a gimmick but no one can afford not to start experimenting with it for one very simple reason facebook wants to supplant google as the number one advertising platform on the internet and they re investing heavily in chatbots to help them do this facebook is no longer a social media company here s why that matters facebook is no longer a social network it s a technology holding company just like google and it now comprises social media photo sharing instagram messaging whatsapp and virtual reality oculus it s also the largest media distributor in history the company has grown with one goal to make it so that no one who uses the internet ever has to leave the facebook platform once we reach peak facebook the point at which the majority of the world s internet users spend all their internet time on one or other of facebook s apps it will become pointless to advertise anywhere else after all facebook already tales up 22% of the internet time that americans spend on mobile devices compared with 11% on google search and youtube combined and facebook s advertising revenues have more than doubled in the last two years to $18 billion in 2015 chatbot failure is not an option and why is facebook so interested in chatbots because by creating its own advertising platform it can control how people buy products and services online specifically the company wants the whole transaction to take place within its own platform so customers never have to leave it and hosting chatbots looks set to be one of the most effective ways of doing this now this trend towards internet dominance may or may not pay off and it certainly throws up some questions about the fact that facebook could end up with complete control or at least de facto dominance over how companies can advertise to their consumers online but facebook s growth has been so phenomenal and its increasing influence so unstoppable that running some kind of chatbot pilot is not something insurers can afford to see as a luxury it s a necessity how insurers can exploit this trend the fastest way to trial your own chatbot is through partnerships and pilots either with technology companies themselves or with innovative startups who aim to solve a business problem that you re struggling with to go back to the example of spixii i mentioned before this company represents an ideal opportunity for insurers to tap into the millennial market and in so doing to investigate how the technology could be extended to reach other markets and develop attractive new propositions and products plus it potentially offers a level of customer engagement and insight for small premium insurance products that just wouldn t be affordable otherwise facebook is serious about this technology if successful it could transform the world of online advertising beyond recognition it may be that insurers can t afford not to trial the technology but those who are successful stand to reap huge potential rewards '),

blockchain the changing nature of venture capital and the reasons she comes to work every morning jesse where do you see dcg s fit in the bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem are you the 800 pound gorilla meltem we talked about this a lot when i first joined dcg why do we come to work in the morning what inspires us what motivates us i think all of us fundamentally see bitcoin blockchain technology changing the financial system and the broader technology landscape it doesn t matter if we re the 800 pound gorilla or the small upstart i think for us we want to have an outsize impact and be an advocate an evangelist and the connector that helps make this industry more successful jesse do you see accelerators as a good idea for bitcoin and blockchain startups meltem yes absolutely one thing i have noticed is that people who have gone through an accelerator program were much better at pitching were much better at selling the value proposition and were much better at creating a narrative that skill set cannot be underestimated you re going through this rigorous program that s designed to teach you all of these fantastic skills and competencies and you re learning from some of the best corporate vcs the best corporate strategists the best vcs the best startup mentors that you normally wouldn t have access to in your network it s a great way to compress that learning in a really short timeline and to really grow your network and also get great pr no brainer for me obviously we re super excited to have startupbootcamp fintech here and really excited about the startups that will go through your program jesse what s your general advice for startups who might be applying for an accelerator meltem i think people are always a little hesitant about applying they think oh it s three months away from product development that s difficult i want to focus on the tech no no no no spend three months really getting good at sales at communicating at branding at messaging building relationships that is going to do so much more for you than building a great product because growth takes two things it takes a great product but it also takes a great sales strategy remember that there s more to the equation than just the technology and really focus on this opportunity to develop relationships and competencies that are going to help you grow beyond the seed stage jesse where do you see the venture capital model heading in five years meltem i think a lot more people are excited about venture capital a lot of people want to be investors it s like a sexy thing to do right now which is great i love it the more money that goes into the ecosystem the more ideas start getting thrown around what i think you re seeing though is a decoupling of the size of the check that an investor s able to write and the value that they re able to add to an early stage company we at dcg invest at the seed stage we aim for 2% to 5% ownership but we write smaller cheques what you re going to start to see are two different types of investors you re going to see one investor who s really focused on network effects on connectivity who s really focused on value added services and another investor that s really focused on late stage growth they re going to play two very different roles within the life cycle of a startup jesse what advice would you have for companies who want to pitch dcg meltem for us we re seed stage investors what our investing team looks at are three things number one the team who are you what s your track record and what s your story why are you starting this company we need to see that you have grit and that you have determination and that you really care the second is product technically what have you built open source software is notoriously competitive so having teams that are technically competent is very important then the last one is market how do you think about monetization and what s the timeline on that we re different from most vcs in that we re not a fund we don t have a certain timeline if it s going to take you 10 years to reach profitability i think we re okay with that but you need to have a plan and then you need to have a backup plan and a backup plan to the backup plan jesse what about the role of community manager how do you see it evolving meltem when i started my role was pretty specific it was focused on developing better connective tissue between our companies now that we have a number of strategic investors on board we started to realize the value of having a broad network for me it s about building the dcg brand building relationships and also creating new opportunities and new ways of thinking around how to internalize innovation within a large organization it s about taking the community role untangling into the various components that really move the needle and making it more of a discipline to read the full interview please click here follow meltem demirors on twitter the digital currency group manages a large early stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain space recently they announced venture round with a number of leading financial institutions and venture capital firms including mastercard bain capital ventures new york life and rre ventures the firm had already established itself as a predominant investor of early stage bitcoin startups with over 50 holdings currently in its portfolio '),

to maintain their market leading positions and gain the trust and business of the next generation what you hear less of is what banks are actually doing to become more innovative we took a look at four different banks and examples of the strategies that they are employing bny mellonbny mellon understands the importance of fostering an innovation culture challenging employees to adopt a flexible mindset that encourages new ways of thinking and an openness to doing things differently bny mellon actively mines its employees for innovative ideas and seeks out exceptional talent internally this focus on intrapreneurship is seen through its annual internal innovation competition a c e this challenges employees to develop innovative ideas rewarding winners with resources and funding to be incubated in one of the bank s innovation centers located in palo alto pittsburgh london new jersey pune and chennai innovation training further helps employees develop ideation skills whilst a social collaboration platform allows employees to discuss new ideas they are working on and collaborate bny mellon s focus on a cultural shift in mindset has begun to manifest itself in real technological innovation and competence the bank s it departments have adopted agile development practices involving small teams that take a continuous delivery approach to development rolling out frequent production updates and reducing delivery time further encouraging an innovative culture the it department has increased its ability to collaborate by sharing resources and knowledge across the entire organization the nexen digital ecosystem was developed by the bank as way to increase the speed of delivery and value to clients nexen is an open sourced cloud based architecture that includes a methodology for developing api s with one language and documentation these api s are available to the company s developers and consumers through an api store where they can utilize the platform s library to create new applications previously developers would create applications in their own language and with separate micro code monitoring now they are able to quickly tie together applications via api and manage them in one cloud based management system because monitoring is built into the nexen system all applications can be tracked and monitored in unison allowing for greater data insights and more intelligent decision making this platform was made possible due to the bank s commitment to encouraging a mindset of innovation by directly addressing the breadth of change required at every level of the organization and getting strong sponsorship from executive levels bbvabbva s strategy and innovation unit was created in 2007 as part of the technology and operations department whose key objective was to integrate emerging technologies into the banking industry resulting in projects such as abil the first smart atm bbva has turned to open innovation models in order to overcome existing challenges and attract the best talent bbva has opened innovation centers such as those in madrid spain and bogota colombia and focused on developing a knowledge network around these this approach depends upon ecosystems for innovation and talent worldwide and seeks to foster a culture of collaboration with entrepreneurs startups and developers the innovation centers generate ideas and accelerates these through a process of experimentation and prototyping the value of this approach was demonstrated in 2008 when bbva became one of the first banks in europe to introduce online money management pfm the innovation centers form hubs points from which to engage with the wider fintech ecosystem bbva has established an innovation network comprised of partners such as tech giants google ibm cisco and microsoft as well as academic institutions like the massachusetts institute of technology mit and stanford commercial organizations like gartner and continuum and startups this sharing of knowledge and ideas encourages cross pollination and helps generate innovation for bbva in addition bbva hosts the open talent challenge now in its 8 sup sup cycle this global startup competition focuses on attracting innovative startups that are transforming financial services offering the winner a place on a two week immersion and interaction program most recently in february 2016 bbva announced the closure of its in house venture arm bbva ventures instead bbva venture s portfolio the $100 million allotted fund and an additional $150 million is being put into a new vc propel venture partners based in san francisco and london bbva has become a limited partner in propel and will focus on payments credit insurance wealth management e commerce and security compliance the move reflects bbva s belief that their increased capital and propel s independence and london presence will attract the best fintech startups santandersantander engages in a wide range of complementary innovation activities most notably santander has launched openbank a fully digital bank several digital labs and innoventures the bank s venture capital arm with a fintech focused fund of over $100 million innoventures invests in fintech startups that the fund believes can add value to the bank s customers this is wide ranging covering everything from payments alternative lending and personal finance management the fund also selects investments based on the value that the bank can bring to the startup by introducing customers helping to establish a strong position within the fintech ecosystem in addition to acting as an investment vehicle innoventures serves as a funnel for startups and new technologies into santander s other innovation initiatives even if innoventures does not invest in a startup there is the opportunity to partner with them to explore new technology or specific use cases through running pilots or proof of concepts openbank is another example of santander s multi layered approach serving the spanish market openbank is a completely digital bank that operates under its own brand but is supported by santander as a completely digital bank the venture offers a unique proposition to customers and is a standalone business openbank is not reliant on santander s central processes and legacy it infrastructure creating additional value as an innovation initiative as startups technologies can be integrated much faster than with santander itself citiciti has developed a portfolio of initiatives engaging both the external innovation ecosystem and creating internal initiatives to encourage new mindsets and ways of working citi ventures oversees a global network of labs and in 2013 established an internal acceleration fund to

 ('237', 'field', '15', 'en_us', ' rainmaking innovation partner nektarios liolios explains what we are all about here at rainmaking and gives an inside look into some of the ways that we are approaching corporate innovation read the full transcript below interview with nektarios liolios my name is nektarios liolios i m one of the partners of rainmaking innovation what we do a rainmaking innovation is we help corporates find ways to innovate as simple as that people joke about the kodak moments but there is a kodak moment the frustration that we see is organizations who are so conservative they actually don t understand that if they don t move faster they re actually running a real risk of failing of disappearing the biggest challenge corporates face with innovation is that they actually don t know what they re doing they get very excited they also feel a lot of pressure to do something and then they randomly do things one of the trends that we see is organizations recognizing that working with startups is one channel but building products startup style is another so the trend is really focusing on closing that loop that s one of the things we see the other one is really diversification so looking at innovation not a box ticking exercise but it s something that has to have many different iterations and many different facets on the positive side we see organizations trying a variety of different things setting up their own investment funds working with accelerators doing their own incubation initiatives having very structured programs for themselves but also putting a lot of effort into internal innovation initiatives by educating people about change by giving them the opportunity to see other ways of working by giving them the opportunity to collaborate with competitors the smart organizations recognize that they need to do multiple things at the same time and they need to allow themselves to fail they also need to connect the internal and external innovation efforts if you just take startup engagement for instance startups come in different stages and they have different needs and also different benefits for the organization so you can be part of an accelerator to see very early stage startups to get excited by the the spirit and the drive and the passion of entrepreneurs but also just to see the very latest trends when it comes to using real technology that has been built by startups then you have to look at something that is maybe a little bit more advanced maybe a little bit more mature but that engagement has to be different maybe it s more like a managed lab maybe it s trying to find ways of incorporating the technology into the business and this is something that often happens by exploring by using something like a startup studio something like a separate entity separate organization that is bringing people together with startup experience and putting them together with project people from the organization who know about the business the interesting thing in this new and evolving landscape is that organizations still sometimes cling on to the idea of we have to do everything ourselves and the smarter organizations recognize that there s certain things that you cannot do as a bank as an insurer as a large corporate by yourself because you don t have the know how you don t have the expertise but also when it comes to collaboration which is really important in this space you usually cannot easily collaborate by yourself with other parties so having a neutral organization having somebody like a startupbootcamp who would come in the middle who brings people around the table and gets them to openly share their challenges share their problems and priorities and get them to jointly engage with startups is something that we ve seen being very successful '),

 ('240', 'field', '15', 'en_us', ' innovation is the new buzzword these days major corporates are tuning their inhouse hierarchy to fit in innovation in their culture vision and value to an extent that nowadays there is a specific job title in major healthcare conglomerates called chief innovation officer to build innovation cultures in the company so what exactly is an innovation culture and why is it suddenly a necessity let us explore this and its role specifically in the field of healthcare innovation culture is a company environment chosen by the leaders to encourage and facilitate unorthodox ideas and strategies in these companies innovation is not just a privilege of the c level but employee at any level is encouraged to foster the culture and be innovative in their approach so why is it suddenly a necessity many companies working the traditional way for decades now suddenly are shifting towards innovation cultures there are several factors contributing to this shift the primary reason for this shift is digitalization digitalization has paced up the market the customer has a strong voice and bad performance instantly gets bad reviews hence the scope of error has reduced hugely making it paramount for companies to invent new ways of customer satisfaction the second factor weighing in is the rise of startups startups are agile and flexible they are not afraid to be different and to try a road not taken because they have nothing to lose large corporates on the other hand have much to lose if they try something that is not a standard norm the third and the most crucial factor is the consumer market consumers have changed trust is still valuable but so is creativity market models have changed and even the old and established market structures are undergoing a change this makes innovation paramount but what does innovation culture comprise of innovation culture is not a pet project it is a style of thinking it is not a creative inborn talent it is a practiced skill which also means that there is not set way or rules to this culture but every team builds its own culture here are some factors we see overlapping in all companies fostering innovation culture 1 speed the need of innovation arises from fast changing market needs hence shorter innovation cycles are paramount speculation over long time leads to slowness the very evil corporations are trying to avoid however speed needs to come from quick decision making and clarity in vision and not rash decisions 2 digitalization digitalization is one of the primary reasons behind the shift in markets so it is imperative for corporates to not just add but make digitalization an integral part of their outreach plan the consumer expects companies to fill gaps and be more service oriented and digitalization is the fastest way to address this need 3 open leadership while it is important for the company founders and leaders to value and encourage innovation cultures in successful innovation culture implementation lower management also believes and practices an open creative culture as these are the people who function directly with execution and micro manage teams 4 value in failure one reason why corporations fail at innovation is because they are risk averse they are big and protecting the name becomes more and more important but as one adopts innovation culture one needs to learn the art of accepting failure an interesting take is to call a failure a glitch while a failure sounds painfully permanent a glitch sounds temporary solvable and a learning opportunity 5 sustaining innovation it is a tough task to get your employees to embrace innovation culture but it is equally important to get them to stay on course it can not be just a one project affair to get employees to show innovativity in workplace there can be rewards from as big as a holiday to as tiny as sincere appreciation 6 flat hierarchy flat hierarchy is a fast evolving management style that many companies are adopting some people call it bossless management some call it radical management and some holacracy but the core of the concept remains the same the concept does away with leadership s sole decision making power and gives the power to the collective intelligence of all employees one good example of holacracy is zappos one of the largest companies to have adopted bossless administration all innovative companies have different missions but their processes are similar they encourage unorthodox methods that include speed flexibility adaptation of digital technology flat hierarchies and sustainable innovation '),
